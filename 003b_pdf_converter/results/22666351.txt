Abstract
Thyroid hormones are required for normal growth and development in mammals. Congenital-neonatal hypothyroidism (CH)
has a profound impact on physiology, but its specific influence in liver is less understood. Here, we studied how CH
influences the liver gene expression program in adulthood. Pregnant rats were given the antithyroid drug methimazole
(MMI) from GD12 until PND30 to induce CH in male offspring. Growth defects due to CH were evident as reductions in body
weight and tail length from the second week of life. Once the MMI treatment was discontinued, the feed efficiency
increased in CH, and this was accompanied by significant catch-up growth. On PND80, significant reductions in body mass,
tail length, and circulating IGF-I levels remained in CH rats. Conversely, the mRNA levels of known GH target genes were
significantly upregulated. The serum levels of thyroid hormones, cholesterol, and triglycerides showed no significant
differences. In contrast, CH rats showed significant changes in the expression of hepatic genes involved in lipid metabolism,
including an increased transcription of PPARa and a reduced expression of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol
uptake, cellular sterol efflux, triglyceride assembly, bile acid synthesis, and lipogenesis. These changes were associated with
a decrease of intrahepatic lipids. Finally, CH rats responded to the onset of hypothyroidism in adulthood with a reduction of
serum fatty acids and hepatic cholesteryl esters and to T3 replacement with an enhanced activation of malic enzyme. In
summary, we provide in vivo evidence that neonatal hypothyroidism influences the hepatic transcriptional program and
tissue sensitivity to hormone treatment in adulthood. This highlights the critical role that a euthyroid state during
development plays on normal liver physiology in adulthood.

Most of the effects of the THs result from their interaction with
TH receptors (TR), which can bind to the TH response element
(TRE) located in several target genes [1]. A TRE is present
upstream of the rat GH gene [5], the product of which has a
significant role in body growth and metabolism in postnatal life
[3]. GH expression is induced by T3 and reduced in hypothyroid
states [6,7,8]. In fact, the growth-promoting effects of T3 can be
largely explained by its ability to induce normal GH secretion and
to regulate the expression patterns of the GH receptor in the liver
and the IGF-I receptor in peripheral tissues [9]. Therefore, the
THs might exert physiological actions on the liver through a direct
transcriptional regulation of several target genes [1] and indirect
mechanisms (e.g., modulating actions of GH and metabolic
sensors such as LXR) [6,7,8,9,10,11]. In addition, it has been
shown that the effects of the THs on glucose metabolism might

Introduction
The thyroid hormones (THs) are essential for development,
growth, and metabolism [1,2,3]. The physiological importance of
the THs becomes evident under the condition of congenitalneonatal hypothyroidism (CH) [2]. If not treated immediately, CH
has a profound impact on physiology and can permanently
imprint neurological and endocrine systems, which, in turn, leads
to mental retardation, growth arrest, and metabolic disturbances.
During ontogeny, there exists a critical period when normal TH
levels are required, and TH replacement after that period cannot
correct the changes in gene expression that was caused by CH.
This is exemplified by abnormal insulin-like growth factor binding
protein (IGBFP)-2 expression in neonatal hypothyroid rats that
can be corrected by TH replacement if started during the first
week of life but not later [4].

the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Las Palmas
de G.C. (permit number: 2006-07824). All efforts were made to
minimize suffering. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6 per group)
were used throughout these experiments. Animals were kept under
a constant dark/light cycle in a controlled temperature (21–23uC)
environment and had free access to a standard diet (A04 SAFE;
Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) and tap water throughout the experiment. For mating purposes, four females were housed overnight
with two males starting at 21:00 h. Females were checked by
7:00 h the next morning, and the presence of a vaginal plug was
designated as gestational day (GD) 0. Within 24 h after birth,
excess pups were removed so that 8 pups were kept per dam. The
indirect MMI exposure method (i.e., through maternal milk)
utilized in this experiment has been extensively employed to
induce a transitory congenital-neonatal hypothyroidism (CH) for
the determination of short- and long-term physiological effects
[4,26,29,30]. Briefly, 0.02% MMI was administered in the
drinking water for pregnant rats from GD12 until weaning at
post-natal day (PND) 30, which is when pups were mature enough
to support their own nutritional needs. The MMI-containing
water was changed twice per week. Untreated rats served as
concurrent euthyroid and age-matched controls (INTACT). Rats
that were weight paired with the CH groups were also included to
control for the effects of reduced body weight on hepatic gene
expression as follows: 1) WP30, weight-paired rats with CH group
on PND30, corresponds to animals that were sacrificed on PND24
and 2) WP, weight-paired rats with CH group on PND80, which
were sacrificed on PND53. For the generation of adult hypothyroid rats (TX), 0.05% MMI was added to the drinking water for 3
weeks [23] starting at PND60 until sacrifice at PND80. Thus, two
additional groups were created as follows: 1) adult TX rats without
CH (TX/2CH) and 2) adult TX rats with CH (TX/+CH). A
schematic diagram of this experimental model is shown in
Supplementary File S1. The presence of hypothyroidism was
corroborated by monitoring the body weight and serum levels of
T3 and T4. During the last week of life, TX rats were either
injected with T3 (20 mg/kg b.w.) as a single daily ip injection or
with GH (0.4 mg/kg/day) divided into two daily sb injections that
were carried out at 08:00 h and 20:00 h. T3 was dissolved in a
minimum volume of 0.01 N NaOH and was brought up to the
appropriate concentration with sterile saline. In parallel, TX
animals received equivalent amounts (0.20 ml) of the vehicle alone
(VEH). Twenty-four hours (in the case of T3) or twelve hours (in
the case of GH) after the last injection, animals were sacrificed by
exsanguination after pentothal anesthesia. Twelve hours before the
rats were sacrificed, the diet was removed from the cages to
minimize the effect of food. Serum samples were collected and
stored at 280uC until analysis. Portions of the liver were snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC until being
processed for mRNA or biochemical analysis.

also be dependent on their actions in the brain, which affect the
autonomic control of peripheral metabolic tissues such as the
adipose tissue in addition to the liver [12,13,14]. These findings
suggest that CH could cause permanent alterations in peripheral
metabolic tissues through irreversible developmental alterations in
the brain. The THs clearly have some lipid-lowering actions, as
demonstrated by recent human studies [15]. For example, the
ability of THs to reduce plasma LDL-c levels has been explained
by its capacity to increase the expression of LDL receptors and the
activities of lipid-lowering enzymes in the liver. THs increase the
number of LDL receptors without necessarily modifying their
transcription, which supports a post-transcriptional regulation of
these proteins [16]. Some lipid-lowering enzymes are direct
transcriptional targets. These are exemplified by the CYP7A1
gene [17,18], the product of which has a major cholesterollowering activity. Malic enzyme (ME) and fatty acid synthase
(FAS), two critical regulators of lipogenesis, are also directly
regulated by the THs [19,20,21]. In contrast, the effects of THs on
other lipogenic genes such as sterol regulatory element-binding
protein (SREBP)-1c are more controversial: THs induced
SREBP1c expression in the livers of rats [22,23], whereas they
strongly downregulated SREBP1c in the livers of mice [24].
In rats, the serum concentrations of the THs are low at birth
and increase progressively, reaching adult levels at approximately
the third week of life when the maturation of the hypothalamuspituitary-thyroid axis is achieved [25]. Administration of the
antithyroid drug methimazole (MMI) to pregnant rats before the
onset of fetal thyroid function is known to abolish both the
maternal and fetal thyroid function [26]. In this context, exposure
to MMI during the fetal-neonatal period of life is an attractive
model to study the influence of CH on the adult pattern of genes
that are under the control of the THs during rat development [4].
In addition, the disturbances in endocrine status during the
neonatal period of life may affect the susceptibility to chronic
diseases or biological insults in adulthood [14,27,28,29,30].
However, the precise mechanism whereby CH influences liver
physiology in adulthood remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that CH might lead to changes in TH and/or GH action
during development that have physiological repercussions in
adulthood. Therefore, there were two aims of this study. First,
we assessed the influence of CH on the somatotropic axis, liver
gene expression, and serum and hepatic lipid biomarkers in
adulthood. Second, we investigated how rats, which were
transiently exposed to CH, adapted to the biological insult of the
onset of hypothyroidism in adulthood. In the present study, we
provide in vivo evidence that exposure to CH alters postnatal
development, which influences the liver transcriptional program
that is associated with altered lipid homeostasis and tissue
sensitivity to hormones.

Materials and Methods
Growth and food intake analysis

Materials

Body weights, tail lengths, and food intake were measured once
a week for all animals. The measurement of tail length was used
for monitoring growth [31,32,33,34]. The percentages of weight
rate (WR) or tail rate (TR) were calculated by the following
formulas: WR = [(W (g) (new) – W (g) (old)/W (g) (old)]*100 or
TR = [(T (cm) (new) – T (cm) (old)/T (cm) (old)]*100, respectively.
Food consumption was estimated by subtracting the amount of
food left on the grid from initial food weight. Food spilled on the
floor of the cage was not weighed, but spillage was minimal
because the diet was supplied as pellets. Mother and pups were
housed in the same cage until weaning on PND30. Then, weaned
pups were housed in pairs to control for food efficiency. The

Recombinant human GH was kindly donated by Pfizer
Laboratories (Spain). Tri-Reagent and the rest of the products
cited in this work were purchased from the Sigma Chemical Co.
(St. Louis, MO), unless otherwise indicated.

Animal study design
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the University of Las Palmas de G.C.
and conducted in accordance with European and Spanish laws
and regulations. The protocol was approved by the Committee on

weekly caloric intake was calculated on the basis of food
consumption x caloric value of the diet (2900 kcal/g). Feed
efficiency (FE), which denotes the body weight increase per gram
of food consumed or the ability to transform calories consumed
into body weight [35], was calculated by the following formula:
mean body weight gain (g)/total caloric intake. The weights of the
liver, heart, and kidneys as well as the organ weight/total body
weight ratios were also calculated on PND30 and PND80.

Data processing and analysis
Image analysis was performed using GenePix Pro 6.0 software
(Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) as previously described [23].
The LOWESS (Locally Weighted Scatter Plot Smoother) method
in the SMA (Statistics for Microarray) [39] package (www.
bioconductor.org) was used to normalize the raw data. The probe
sets not present in at least three of the four chips were considered
as meaningless and therefore were eliminated to reduce data
complexity. Identification of differentially expressed genes was
performed using the SAM (Significance Analysis for Microarrays)
statistical technique [40]. A q value was assigned to each of the
detectable genes in the array. This value is similar to a P-value and
measure the lowest false discovery rate (FDR) at which the
differential expression of a gene is considered significant. A
minimal FDR of 0.05 was assigned for each gene. An additional
selection requirement was added to this statistically based
criterion, which was based on the absolute changes in the gene
expression ratios. A value of 1.5 (50%) (log2 ratio CH/
INTACT$|0.58|) was chosen to describe ratios as up- or
downregulated. Functional classifications (Gene Ontology) and
pathway analysis (KEGG) of differentially expressed genes that
were affected by CH were performed by using the web-based tool
DAVID [41]. All microarray data are MIAME compliant, and the
raw data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus
database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo).

Serum IGF-I, TSH, T3, and T4 analysis
The serum levels of IGF-I (Quantikine; R&D Systems) and
TSH (Gentaur Molecular Products, Belgium) were determined by
using rat immunoassays and following the manufacturers’
recommendations. All of the samples were assayed together, and
each sample was assayed in duplicate. The serum free T4 and T3
concentrations (ng/dl) were measured in duplicate by an enzyme
immunoassay (Access Immunoassay Systems, Beckman Coulter,
Inc., USA) with detection limits of 0.60 ng/dl and 88 ng/dl,
respectively.

Serum lipid analysis
Lipoproteins were separated essentially as previously described
[36] using a SuperoseH-12 PC 3.2/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech,
Uppsala, Sweden). Serum from each animal (2.5 mL) was
separated for cholesterol and triglycerides, which were subsequently assayed on-line. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were
assayed using cholesterol and triglyceride colorimetric enzymatic
kits (Roche/Hitachi Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).
The serum triglyceride value for each animal was normalized to
the respective glycerol content. Absorbance was continuously
measured at 500 nm, and data were collected every 10 s using EZ
ChromTM software (Scientific Software, San Ramon, CA).

Gene expression analysis by real-time quantitative PCR
(qPCR)
The mRNA expression levels of genes were measured using
qPCR as previously described [23]. Briefly, 2 mg of total RNA was
treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega) and reverse
transcribed by using an iScriptTM kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Two microliters of cDNA served as a template in a 20-ml qPCR
reaction mix containing the primers and SYBR Green PCR
Master mix (Diagenode, Belgium). Quantification of the gene
expression was performed with an ABI PRISMH 7000 SD PCR
System. A dissociation protocol was performed to assess the
specificity of the primers and the uniformity of the PCR generated
products. Exon-specific primers were designed by the Primer 3
program [42] and are listed in Supplementary File S2. The level of
individual mRNAs measured by qPCR was normalized to the
level of the housekeeping genes cyclophilin and ribosomal 28S by
using the Pfaffl method [43]. For graphing purposes, the relative
expression levels were scaled such that the expression of the
INTACT control group equalled one.

Hepatic lipid analysis
Frozen liver aliquots were used for lipid extraction [37], and
aliquots of lipid extracts were quantified after separation by onedimensional TLC [38] and image analysis using the G5-700
Bioimage TLC scanner (Bio-Rad, CA). The spots were quantified
as integrated optical density against an internal standard of
cholesteryl formate and against calibration curves of the different
lipid standards.

RNA isolation, cDNA microarray, probe preparation, and
hybridization
Total RNA was isolated by the homogenization of frozen liver
as previously described [23]. All samples were treated with RNasefree DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). The RNA yields were
measured by UV absorbance, and the quality of total RNA was
analyzed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA). A microarray containing 27,000 rat 70-mer oligo probe
sets, which was produced at the KTH Microarray Center (www.
biotech.kth.se), was used to evaluate the effects of CH on liver gene
expression in adulthood. Five micrograms of high-quality total
RNA from liver was reversed-transcribed, labeled, and hybridized
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ProntoTM Plus System;
Promega). After 16 h of hybridization, the slides were scanned
using a GenePix Microarray Scanner (Axon Instruments, CA).
Four independent hybridizations were performed to compare
individual animals from the CH group (n = 4) with those from the
INTACT group (n = 4) on PND80 for a total of four analyses.

Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as the means 6 SD. The significance of
differences between the groups was tested by either a two-tailed
Student’s t test or a one-way ANOVA, which was followed by post
hoc comparisons of the group means according to the GraphPad
Prism 5 program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A twotailed Student’s t test was performed on PND80 for body weight
and tail length to assess the effect of CH and the completeness of
recovery. Statistical significance was reported if P,0.05 was
achieved.

throughout gestation (data not shown). There were no apparent
MMI treatment-related effects on the offspring’s body weights over
the 3–4 PND. As expected [4,26], the INTACT pups on the tap
water recorded normal size and growth during development, while
defects due to the MMI treatment in CH rats were evident by a
reduction in body weight (Supplementary File S3; panel A) and tail
length (Supplementary File S3; panel B) from the second week of
life. Upon weaning on PND30, biochemical hypothyroidism was
shown, and significantly low circulating T3 (pg/ml) (9.9360.66 vs.
7.8060.83; P = 0.0008) and elevated TSH (ng/ml) (2.7362.04 vs.
6.7262.5; P = 0.012) levels were found in CH rats in comparison
with the age-matched INTACT group. In addition, circulating
IGF-I (ng/ml) levels were reduced by 55% in the CH group
(716.336132.62 vs. 323.25645.97; P = 0.0001). Furthermore, the
mRNA levels of ME (0.1560.10 vs. 160.04; P = 0.0001) and
Spot14 (0.3060.10 vs. 160.02; P = 0.0001), two genes positively
regulated by TH [1], were also markedly reduced in the CH
group. In liver, the fetal expression pattern of high IGFBP-2 levels
was replaced by the adult pattern of low levels of IGFBP-2 only in
the presence of normal levels of TH during rat development [4].
CH rats expressed higher levels of IGFBP2 mRNA in comparison
with the INTACT or WP control rats (Supplementary File S3;
panel C). Collectively, these data support the presence of neonatal
hypothyroidism on PND30.
Once the MMI treatment was discontinued on PND30, the
animals gradually recovered and significant catch-up (defined as
growth rate that is greater than normal for age after a period of
growth inhibition) [44] occurred in terms of body weight
(Supplementary File S3; panel D) and tail length (Supplementary
File S3; panel E). It was evident in all hypothyroid rats that, when
MMI was withdrawn, they rapidly began to increase their growth
rates in a compensatory manner to make up for their deficits and
to catch up with the normal age-matched control rats. These
results suggest that, in agreement with what has been previously
shown [45,46,47,48], the plasma levels of THs were rapidly
recovered (i.e., within 2–4 days after discontinuation of MMI
treatment). Interestingly, the feed efficiency was significantly
increased in CH rats (Supplementary File S3; panel F). On
PND80, a statistically significant difference remained in body mass
(g) (430629.69 vs. 333629.72; P = 0.002) (Supplementary File S3;
panel A), tail length (cm) (21.960.62 vs. 20.360.73; P = 0.002)
(Supplementary File S3; panel B), and circulating IGF-I levels (ng/

ml) (1541.24676.74 vs. 1305.156126.27; P = 0.003) between
INTACT and CH groups, respectively, indicating that growth was
incomplete. Importantly, at the time of sacrifice, the growth rate,
measured as a percentage of body weight gain (Fig. 1A) or tail
length gain (Fig. 1B), was similar between the two groups, which
suggests that the CH animals may have finished a period of rapid
catch-up growth. The weights of the liver and kidneys at the end of
the study (i.e., PND80), corrected by total body weight, were
similar in the CH rats in comparison with age-matched INTACT
rats (data not shown), which also suggests that the compensatory
growth of organs in relation to body weight was achieved.
Furthermore, on PND80, the serum levels of T3 (ng/dl)
(45.1565.77 vs. 47.5263.17), T4 (ng/dl) (1.9460.27 vs.
1.5260.18), total cholesterol (mM) (1.5460.15 vs. 1.6560.21),
and triglycerides (mM) (1.2060.23 vs. 1.1860.28) in the CH
group did not differ from the INTACT animals. Subtle changes in
hepatic IGF-I (Fig. 2A) and IGFBP-3 (Fig. 2B) mRNA levels
together with increased levels of IGFBP-2 (Fig. 2C), a gene that is
a marker of delayed development or hypothyroidism in rats [4,49],
were also shown on PND80. Because the expression of IGFBP-2
mRNA levels was similar in the CH and WP groups, this result
indicates that the overexpression is a consequence of delayed
growth and low body weight rather than a long-lasting
consequence of CH. However, in comparison with age-matched
INTACT rats, several genes remained unaltered or were
upregulated in CH rats whereas they were significantly downregulated in the WP control group (Fig. 3–5). Collectively, these
results suggest that the induction of neonatal hypothyroidism alters
the normal development of the liver gene expression program,
which may impact GH-related liver functions.

Influence of neonatal hypothyroidism on Growth
Hormone-regulated genes
An altered growth rate or a long-lasting influence on
somatotropic axis (i.e., GH, liver and IGF-I) could be related to
the effects of CH on the hepatic GH signaling system [50,51]. To
test this hypothesis, we next analyzed the mRNA expression levels
of the GH-regulated genes CIS and SOCS2, which act as negative
regulators of GH signaling. On PND30, the CIS mRNA
expression level was significantly upregulated (P,0.001) in CH
rats (9.9364.45) in comparison with the INTACT (160.03) and
WP30 (0.8760.67) groups, whereas SOCS2 remained unchanged.

In order to determine whether the decreased hepatic content of
lipids in CH rats was due to increased lipid catabolism, decreased
lipid synthesis, increased lipid excretion, or some combination of
these mechanisms, we analyzed the hepatic mRNA levels for
proteins mediating these processes by using qPCR. First, Figure 4A
shows that the mRNA levels of PPARa, a master regulator of boxidation, were upregulated in the CH group. Similar results were
observed when measuring the mRNA expression of carnitine
palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT1) (Fig. 4B), a PPARa target gene
coding for a protein that is important for transferring fatty acylCoAs into the mitochondria for b-oxidation [53]. In contrast,
PPARa (Fig. 4A) and CPT1 (Fig. 4B) were downregulated in the
WP group. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), a ratelimiting gene in gluconeogenesis, remained unaltered in the CH
group, whereas it was significantly reduced in the WP control
group (data not shown).
ME is a TH-regulated enzyme that converts malate into
pyruvate to generate NADPH which is destined for lipogenesis
and other biosynthetic processes [54]. We found that the ME
mRNA levels (Fig. 4C) were upregulated in the CH rats on
PND80, but the levels of SREBP1c (Fig. 4D), a master regulator of
lipogenesis, were significantly downregulated. The SREBP1c
target genes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1) (Fig. 4E), the
product of which is the rate-limiting metabolite for fatty acid
biosynthesis and inhibits CPT-1 [55], and fatty acid synthase
(FAS) (Fig. 4F), as well as several genes known to be regulated by
PPARa such as CYP4F1 (Fig. 4G), palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (AOX)
(Fig. 4H) and liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) (Fig. 4I),
were not affected in the CH group whereas they were significantly
reduced in the WP control group. The steady-state mRNA level
for insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG-1) (Fig. 5A), an SREBP target,
was also reduced in the CH rats. Overall, our data do not support
the activation of a lipogenic program in the CH rats. Interestingly,
the hepatic mRNA expression levels of SREBP2 (Fig. 5B) and its
target gene LDLR (Fig. 5C), the product of which is involved in
hepatic VLDL uptake, were 2–3-fold lower in the CH rats
compared with the INTACT rats. Similar results were obtained
for the gene expression levels of CD36 (Fig. 5D), which is involved
in the uptake of FFA and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein
(MTTP) (data not shown), which is involved in triglycerides
assembly, indicating that diminished uptake of fatty acids may
contribute to the reduced hepatic TG levels observed in the CH
rats [56]. ABCA1 (Fig. 5E), a transporter responsible for
cholesterol efflux, was also reduced whereas LXR (Fig. 5F),

However, on PND80, SOCS2 (Fig. 3A) and CIS (Fig. 3B) were
upregulated whereas SOCS3 (Fig. 3C) and additional GHindependent negative regulators of STAT-mediated signaling such
as PIAS3 (Fig. 3D) and SOCS5 (Fig. 3E) were downregulated. We
next explored whether the increased hepatic expression of SOCS2
and CIS mRNA levels in adult rats exposed to CH was associated
with a negative regulation of GH target genes or instead reflected
enhanced GH signaling. CYP2C11 (Fig. 3F) and CYP2C13
(Fig. 3G), two biomarkers of the male gene expression pattern in
rats that are under GH control [52], were overexpressed in CH in
comparison with the INTACT or WP groups, whereas the femalepredominant CYP2C7 gene was downregulated (Fig. 3H). These
results show that CH influences the mRNA regulation of GH
target genes in the adult liver. The absence of major effects on
IGF-I expression suggests the presence of complex transcriptional
mechanisms in vivo that deserve further research.

Neonatal hypothyroidism influences the liver gene
expression program in adulthood, and it is associated
with decreased levels of intrahepatic lipids
To better understand the influence of transient neonatal
hypothyroidism on adult liver physiology, we next carried out an
exploratory analysis of the global gene expression changes in the
CH group on PND80 compared to INTACT rats by using DNA
microarrays. We identified the set of genes that were differentially
regulated in the CH group and analyzed the biological processes
represented based on gene annotations in the Gene Ontology
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) and the KEGG pathway databases
[41]. These exploratory analyses indicated that genes with altered
expression in the CH group were functionally related to lipid
metabolism (P = 0.0001). In particular, ‘‘PPARa’’ was the
signaling pathway (KEGG) most represented among the CH
regulated genes, suggesting alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism
even in the absence of overt changes in circulating cholesterol and
triglyceride levels (see below). Accordingly, our study showed that
the hepatic content (mg/g of tissue; n = 6) of triglycerides
(3.9160.6 vs. 1.4960.18; P,0.001), cholesteryl esters
(0.3060.02 vs. 0.2160.04; P,0.001), free fatty acids (FFA)
(0.1860.03 vs. 0.1360.004; P,0.05), and phospholipids
(57.864.1 vs. 48.768.8; P,0.05) were significantly reduced in
CH in comparison with INTACT rats. However, no changes in
the free cholesterol (2.460.2 vs. 2.160.3) content (mg/g of tissue)
were observed.

In contrast, the mRNA expression levels of LXR, HL, HMGCoAR, and HMGCoA-S were significantly downregulated in the WP

these data indicate that a transient neonatal exposure to
hypothyroidism causes changes in lipid metabolism in the liver
and, particularly, in the cholesterol metabolism pathway that
persist long after removal of the original insult, in animals that are
euthyroid and exhibit similar growth rate as intact rats.

Neonatal hypothyroidism influences the hepatic
response to hormone replacement in adulthood
Although CH rats were euthyroid on PND80 (i.e., the time
when the comparative gene expression was performed), they
showed changes in liver gene expression in comparison with agematched INTACT rats (see above) that involved previously
characterized T3 (e.g., ME) or GH (e.g.SOCS2, CIS, IGF-I,
CYP2C11, INSIG-1, and IGFBP-3) regulated genes. Thus, we
hypothesized that the different transcriptional profile in the CH

group could be explained by altered tissue responsiveness to T3
and/or GH, two hormones that are drastically reduced by
hypothyroidism [6,7,8]. To test this hypothesis, we developed a
second burst of hypothyroidism (TX) in adulthood, which was
followed by hormone replacement as described in ‘‘Materials and
Methods’’. As expected, in vehicle or GH-treated TX rats, the
serum levels of T3 were significantly reduced whereas the levels of
T3-replaced animals did not differ from the INTACT control rats
(data not shown). We showed a decrease in the total body weights
of TX rats (P,0.001) and little subsequent weight gain in the TX/
2CH (Fig. 7A) and TX/+CH rats (Fig. 7B). Independent of CH
status, we showed the following: 1) the development of TX
increased the circulating cholesterol levels and decreased the
triglyceride serum levels (Table 1), which were mainly due to an
increase of LDL and HDL cholesterol and a decrease of VLDL
(data not shown), respectively, while the T3 hormone replacement
restored the circulating cholesterol; 2) T3 and GH treatments
increased the body weight gain in TX rats but it was unable to
normalize it completely (Fig. 7A,B); and 3) T3 and GH treatments
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org

increased the hepatic level of IGF-I mRNA and, unlike T3, GH
was capable of fully restoring the level to normal (Fig. 7C).
However, the development of TX in the CH group (i.e., TX/
+CH) resulted in a greater than 3-fold reduction of circulating
FFAs, which was not observed in the TX/2CH group, and the
T3 replacement restored it (Table 1). Next, we evaluated the
effects of hormone replacement on the hepatic lipid content
(Table 2). Independent of the CH status, T3 treatment restored
hepatic cholesterol levels. However, in comparison with INTACT,
GH increased the hepatic cholesteryl esters in the TH/2CH but
not in the TH/+CH group. Additionally, to evaluate whether an
altered response to the T3 treatment was associated with an
altered transcriptional response, we measured the changes in gene
expression of T3-regulated genes such as ME and FAS. The effect
of GH was also measured. As expected, the development of TX in
TX/2CH rats significantly reduced the mRNA levels of ME
(Fig. 7D) and FAS (Fig. 7E). However, the development of TX in
the TX/+CH group did not decrease ME (Fig. 7D) and,
surprisingly, increased the mRNA levels of FAS up to 5-fold

influenced by CH.

(Fig. 7E). Furthermore, T3 replacement in the TX/2CH rats
increased the mRNA expression levels of ME and FAS by 12- and
3-fold, respectively. However, T3 replacement in the TX/+CH
rats increased the expression of ME up to 30-fold which suggested
an altered tissue sensitivity to T3 replacement. Taken together,
these findings suggest that the tissue responsiveness to TH was
altered in rats previously exposed to CH. At this point, we can only
speculate about the molecular mechanisms that could support our
hypothesis. However, because altered hepatic levels of TR might
support a different metabolic response to TH in the liver
[12,14,59], we made an exploratory analysis of the expression of
TRb/TRa mRNA in the CH rats. The hepatic mRNA level of
TRa (Fig. 7F) was significantly reduced in the CH group whereas
the TRb mRNA (Fig. 7G) remained unaltered. However, the

Discussion
The THs are essential for development, growth, and metabolism [1,2,3]. The present study shows that transient neonatal
hypothyroidism in male rats gave rise to endocrine alterations that
not only affected postnatal growth but also influenced hepatic
physiology and responsiveness to THs replacement in adulthood.
Growth-inhibiting conditions exist during development in
association with malnutrition, glucocorticoid excess, systemic
diseases, GH-IGF-I deficiency, or hypothyroidism [44,60,61]. In
this work, several biomarkers of neonatal hypothyroidism (i.e.,
decreased circulating THs and hepatic mRNA expression levels of
ME and Spot14) and high expression of IGFBP-2 were associated

with decreased circulating IGF-I and a delayed somatic growth
rate on PND30. Furthermore, when the growth-inhibiting
condition (i.e., MMI) was removed, somatic growth rate (weight
and tail lenght gain) and food efficiency increased in CH rats,
which is a phenomenon known as catch-up growth [44,60]. By
PND80, however, this effect had subsided, and somatic growth
rate (see body weight gain and tail length gain in Supplementary
File S3) in CH animals was similar to age-matched INTACT
controls. Alternatively, higher food efficiency remained in
euthyroid CH group on PND80 along with significance differences
in total body weight and size in comparison with INTACT group,
which suggests, in agreement with previously reported data [62], a
higher but less efficient rate of metabolism (i.e., a reduced ability to
transform calories consumed into total body weight and size) in
rats previously exposed to CH. The CH rats on PND80 also
showed increased mRNA levels of several GH target genes (i.e.,
IGF-I, SOCS-2, CIS, CYP2C11, CYP2C13) suggesting that the
increased hepatic GH activity observed in these animals was
possibly associated with catch-up growth. In contrast, other wellknown GH target genes in female rats such as CYP2C7 and CD36
were downregulated in CH group. This apparent paradox could
be explained by sexually dimorphic pattern of gene expression in
rat liver [63,64]. The downregulation of female-predominant
genes (e.g., CYP2C7 and CD36) concomitant with the induction
of male-predominant genes (e.g., CYP2C11 and CYP2C13)
suggests that a male pattern of gene expression was enhanced in
CH rat liver.
In the current study, we show that transient CH is associated
with changes in SOCS-2 and CIS expression, which are key

negative regulators of GH-dependent somatic growth in vivo
[51,65]. GH resistance can be shown in rat models of sepsis and
uremia and in small rats for gestational age (SGA) without catchup growth. This was associated with an increased expression of
SOCS-2 and CIS and impaired JAK/STAT signaling [66,67,68].
In our model, however, catch-up growth was associated with the
overexpression of SOCS-2 and CIS in adult CH rats. Whether the
overexpression of SOCS and CIS is associated with delayed
growth development and catch-up growth in CH rats requires
further research.
Growth-inhibiting conditions during fetal-neonatal period of life
may influence lipid metabolism in adulthood [69,70,71,72].
Human and rats, who do show catch-up of somatic growth and
increased feed efficiency after withdrawal of growth-inhibiting
condition (e.g., SGA or caloric restriction), have higher risk of fat
in the liver and increased adiposity in adulthood [69,70,71,72].
Now, we show that somatic growth inhibition by neonatal
hypothyroidism influences hepatic lipid metabolism in adulthood.
CH rats showed a concomitant upregulation of PPARa and
CPT1, a gene related to fatty acid catabolism. Furthermore, adult
CH rats showed a downregulation of CD36, which is involved in
fatty acid uptake and a well-known PPARa target gene, along with
the reduced transcription of genes involved in cholesterol uptake
(LDLR), cellular sterol efflux (ABCA), triglyceride assembly
(MTTP), bile acid synthesis (CYP8B1, CYP7A1 and CYP27A1),
and lipogenesis (SREBP1c) [73]. These data indicate that CH
significantly influenced lipid metabolism in adulthood and, most
likely, contributed to the diminished hepatic levels of triglycerides,
cholesteryl esters, and FFA. Conversely, because expression levels

likely associated with increased level of hepatic lipids and adiposity
[72], which would not be in agreement with this explanation.
Additionally, despite all of the changes observed in liver, the levels
of circulating lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol) and lipoproteins
(data not shown) were similar to those in the INTACT agedmatched littermates, which suggest that CH rats were able to
maintain lipid homeostasis and support the increased energy
demands imposed by an accelerated growth rate. This is
apparently achieved by redistributing lipids from the liver towards
peripheral tissues rather than through active hepatic lipogenesis,
which is an energy-consuming process that would compete with
peripheral energy needs.
In this study, we show that transient neonatal hypothyroidism
influences transcriptional program in adult liver. Despite being
euthyroid, adult CH animal showed a modified transcriptional

of several lipid genes in CH adult group were altered in similar
direction to that detected in WP group, our data could be
explained, in part, as a consequence of delayed growth [33,34].
Furthermore, a reduced content of hepatic lipids in CH group
could be caused by prolonged catch-up growth which might cause
an increased lipid catabolism in growing animals (i.e., CH group)
in comparison with those that have completed their body growth
(i.e., INTACT). To determine whether some of these changes
caused by CH are life-long adaptations, similar analysis would
need to be performed in older animals [33,34]. Furthermore, the
reduced content of hepatic lipids in CH group could be caused by
prolonged catch-up growth which might cause increased lipid
catabolism in growing animals (i.e., CH group) in comparison with
those that have completed their body growth (i.e., INTACT).
However, several reports have suggested that catch-up growth is

circulating cholesterol level. Additionally, T3 and GH treatments
increased the body weight gain and hepatic levels of IGF-I mRNA.
At first glance, these results suggested that the CH rats, after
suffering a biological insult (i.e., a second burst of hypothyroidism
in adulthood), showed a biological response similar to agematched INTACT rats. However, several of the responses to TX
or hormone replacement suggested an altered lipid metabolism in
the CH rats. First, a significant reduction of circulating FFAs by
TX in TX/+CH group but not in TX/2CH group, an effect that
was restored by T3 replacement. Second, GH-increased hepatic
cholesterol esterification occurred in the TH/2CH animals but
not in the TH/+CH animals. Third, GH treatment reduced
serum VLDL fraction in the TX/2CH but not in the TX/+CH
rats (data not shown). We did not observe major alterations in
hepatic reactivity to GH in terms of lipid changes which suggests
that the capacity of GH treatment to reduce serum triglyceride
levels in TX/2CH rats, but not in TX/+CH rats, is most likely
due to altered GH activity in extrahepatic tissues, such as fat and
muscle [3]. Finally, hepatic concentrations of lipids in T3-treated
TX/+CH rats did not differ significantly from TX/2CH group,
which suggested that the homeostatic capacity of CH tissue in
response to T3 was not dramatically affected. However, this is in
contrast to the enhanced ME expression in the TX/+CH group in
response to the T3 treatment. Increased ME mRNA expression
did not seem to be a general response to T3 replacement because
SREBP1c and 2 showed a less pronounced change (data not
shown). ME is directly regulated by the binding of TR to a TRE in
the promoter of the ME gene [74]. Our measurement of mRNA
levels for TR receptors in liver showed unaltered expression of the
major isoform TRb and reduced levels of TRa, making it unlikely
that changes in ME expression can be attributed to altered TR
content. Noticeably, the ME regulatory region also contains
binding sites for PBX1 and 2 [75], CEBPa [76], and an E-box
[77] that can modulate the response to T3. At this point, we
cannot exclude the possibility that CH effects on these transcription factors and other nuclear co-regulators influence ME
expression but additional experiments are needed to test this
hypothesis. Likewise, a clearer mechanistic explanation for the

Congenital Hypothyroidism and Liver

metabolic changes observed in the CH rats would require, among
others measures, the analysis of fat and muscle metabolism.
Androgens may influence the hepatic response to CH. It is well
known that neonatal hypothyroidism results in increased circulating levels of testosterone in male rats, which is secondary to
increased testis size [29]. We also observed two-fold higher serum
testosterone levels in the CH rats compared to the age-matched
adult INTACT rats (data not shown). Although the liver is not
considered to be a primary target of testosterone action, androgens
maintain specific male pattern of pituitary GH secretion and
actions on liver [78], and it has been shown that specific deletion
of androgen receptor (AR) in liver of male animals causes hepatic
insulin resistance with decreased fatty acid b-oxidation and
steatosis [79], which implicates the hepatic AR as a positive factor
in maintaining physiological control of glucose and lipid homeostasis. Alternatively, in prostate, a well-known target tissue of
androgen action, testosterone has lipogenic effects, such as
inducing the expression of FAS [80]. Therefore, we cannot
exclude the possibility that some of the transcriptional effects
detected in the liver of the CH rats (e.g., increased CYP2C11,
CYP2C13, and PPARa) were secondary to increased levels of
circulating testosterone.
In summary, our findings support the hypothesis that TH
deprivation during neonatal period of life causes long-lasting
influence on the liver transcriptome and provokes an altered
responsiveness to biological insult in adulthood. Several findings
that cannot be explained by the lower body weight in CH rats,
compared to WP, include genes regulated by GH (e.g., IGF-I,
CIS, CYP2C11, and CYP2C13) and genes involved in hepatic
lipid metabolism (e.g., PPARa, CPT1, ME, ACC1, FAS,
CYP4F1, AOX, L-FABP, LXR, HMGCoA-S, and HMGCoAR). Being clinically relevant, the changes observed in the
transcriptional responses to T3 highlight the possibility that CH
influences tissue reactivity to thyromimetic drugs in adulthood
[81]. Interestingly, thyroid-disrupting compounds, which can
cause neonatal hypothyroidism, include a wide range of chemicals
from naturally occurring compounds, pharmaceuticals, and a
number of xenobiotics [82]. The long-lasting influence of growthinhibiting conditions on hepatic metabolism is intriguing and
warrants further study to explore whether the alterations observed
in this study cause metabolic disruptions or chronic diseases.
