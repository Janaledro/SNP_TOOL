Abstract
Background—Obesity is a strong risk factor for resistance to insulin-mediated glucose disposal,
a precursor of type 2 diabetes and other disorders.
Objectives—To identify molecular pathways that may cause such obesity-associated insulin
resistance in human subjects, we exploited the fact that not all obese individuals are prone to
insulin resistance. Thus the degree of obesity as a variable was removed by studying morbidly
obese human subjects of similar BMI values who are insulin-sensitive versus insulin-resistant.
Setting—University Medical Center, United States
Methods—Combining gene expression profiling with computational approaches, we determined
the global gene expression signatures of omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples
obtained from similarly obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Results—Gene sets related to chemokine activity and chemokine receptor-binding were
identified as most highly expressed in the omental tissue from insulin-resistant compared to
insulin sensitive subjects, independent of BMI. These upregulated genes included chemokines
CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL18 and IL8/CXCL8, and were not differentially expressed in
subcutaneous adipose tissues between the two groups of subjects. Strikingly, insulin resistance,
but not BMI, was associated with increased macrophage infiltration in the omental adipose tissue,
as was adipocyte size, in these morbidly obese subjects.
Conclusions—Our findings demonstrate that inflammation of omental adipose tissue is strongly
associated with insulin resistance in human obesity even in subjects with similar BMI values.
Increased omental fat mass may contribute to the amplified inflammatory response observed in
this population.

Introduction
The prevalence and severity of obesity are increasing dramatically in the United States and
throughout the world1. Obesity is closely associated with insulin resistance which is
characterized by a decreased response to insulin signaling in several peripheral tissues
including adipose, liver and muscle2. Interestingly, not all obese individuals are insulinresistant3,4, highlighting the importance of identifying genetic and environmental factors
that place obese individuals at the greatest risk for obesity-related complications. The role of
adipose tissue in controlling whole-body metabolism is being increasingly recognized5. In
addition to its role as an energy storage depot, the adipose tissue secretes numerous
hormones and cytokines that function to regulate food intake and nutrient homeostasis6.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Obesity is associated with the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and macrophage
infiltration into adipose tissue, which ultimately impairs the energy storage capability and
endocrine function of the adipose tissue7,8,9,10,11. Despite increasing awareness of the role
inflamed adipose tissue plays in obesity related co-morbidities (i.e. insulin resistance,
dyslipidemia, hypertension), there is limited understanding of the molecular signals that
initiate the inflammatory process. To address this question, most gene expression profiling
studies have examined differences in adipose tissue gene expression between obese and lean
subjects and found that obesity is associated with an increase in the expression of
proinflammatory genes12,13. These studies, however, cannot reveal genes responsible for
the metabolically compromised status of some obese individuals compared to other obese
individuals.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify genes potentially involved in mediating obesity-related insulin resistance, we
determined the gene expression profiles of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue from
obese insulin-resistant and obese insulin-sensitive adults that were matched for BMI.
Assessing differences in adipose tissue gene expression between obese subjects who differ
in insulin sensitivity, yet are matched for the extent of obesity has not been previously
published. Our hypothesis was that candidate genes identified by differential expression in
this screen would be directly related to insulin resistance and not simply a feature of the
obese state. We found a set of parameters that were strikingly associated with omental
adipose tissue of insulin resistant obese subjects compared to the BMI-matched insulin
sensitive obese individuals: elevated expression of genes encoding chemokines, increased
macrophage infiltration and increased adipocyte size. The data suggest that these changes
may be primary rather than secondary to the occurrence of insulin resistance.

Materials and Methods
Patients
Adult patients undergoing a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery between
October 2005 and May 2009 were recruited from the University of Massachusetts Memorial
Medical Center, a tertiary care academic hospital in a metropolitan setting in central New
England. All patients were qualified for gastric bypass surgery under published NIH
consensus guidelines for the treatment of morbidly obese patients14. Morbidly obese
insulin-resistant patients were matched for body mass index (BMI) to morbidly obese
insulin-sensitive patients. Demographic data including age, gender, height, weight,
calculated BMI and fasting glucose and insulin levels were recorded at the time of gastric

bypass surgery. A lipid profile (triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol) was obtained prior to
surgery. Patients with diabetes mellitus were excluded from this study because treatment of
this metabolic disorder has been shown to alter the gene expression profile15. Adipose tissue
samples were taken from lower abdominal wall (subcutaneous) and greater omentum
(visceral). All subjects provided written informed consent before taking part in the study.
The study was approved by the University of Massachusetts Medical School Institutional
Review Board.
Insulin sensitivity
After an overnight fast, pre-operative serum levels of insulin and glucose were determined.
A solid phase chemiluminescent immunoassay was used to determine serum insulin levels
(IMMULITE 2000 Insulin), whereas levels of serum glucose were determined by an oxygen
rate method employing a Beckman Oxygen electrode (SYNCHRON LX Systems). The
homeostatic model of assessment (HOMA2-IR) was used to estimate insulin resistance
(http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk) by using fasting glucose (mg/dL) and fasting insulin levels (mIU/
mL). A cut point of HOMA2-IR ≥ 2.3 was used to characterize subjects as being insulin
resistant as validated by previous studies in this patient population16.
Microarray Study

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Paired samples of omental and subcutaneous adipose were obtained from fasting patients
during gastric bypass surgery. Whole adipose tissue was dissected to remove fibrotic tissue
and obvious vasculature, and frozen in 0.5 cm3 sections in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was
isolated from frozen human tissues by homogenizing the tissue in TRIzol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). RNA quality was assessed using a denaturing agarose gel. Total RNA was
purified using RNeasy Mini-Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Ten micrograms of purified total
RNA was prepared according to Affymetrix protocols. Prepared cRNA was hybridized to
Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

GeneChip Expression Array Analysis for individual genes was performed as previously
published17 filtering for p-value <0.05 and fold change ≥ 2. This method was used to rank
the genes expressed differentially between insulin sensitive and insulin resistant patients in
both adipose depots. The gene lists that were obtained using the filtering parameters
mentioned above were entered into the Database for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) bioinformatics database
(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp)18, 19 to determine which molecular functions were
most represented in the top-scoring genes using information obtained from the Gene
Ontology Consortium (http://www.geneontology.org). The data discussed in this publication
have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO
Series accession number GSE20950.
Real-time PCR
RNA isolated from the visceral adipose tissue from the original cohort of twenty patients
was analyzed to confirm the microarray analysis findings. cDNA was synthesized using
iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Quantitative real-time PCR for
specific genes was performed using SybrGreen normalized to beta 2 microglobulin. Primers
were designed using PrimerBank which is a public resource for PCR primers using a primer
design algorithm that has been tested by real-time PCR experiments for PCR specificity and
efficiency (pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank) 20. Melting curve data was collected to
visualize the presence of primer dimers. We used the following primers for RT-PCR: CCL2sense, 5′-CCC CAG TCA CCT GCT GTT AT-3′; CCL2-antisense, 5′-TGG AAT CCT GAA

method.
Adipose tissue histology
Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin from which multiple
5-mm sections were obtained. Images were acquired using an Axioskop2 Plus (Zeiss,
Göttingen, Germany) coupled to a Spot RTKe (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc) and were
analyzed using SPOT 4.0.2 software. For each subject, adipocyte cell diameter was
calculated from the perimeter measurement (Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended) and averaged
using 100 cells. Immunohistochemical detection of CD68 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies,
Heidelberg, Germany) diluted 1:50 was performed with the avidinbiotin peroxidase method.
Adipocytes and CD68+ cells were counted at 10x magnification in ten different randomly
chosen areas in each processed slide.

Statistical analysis
Baseline differences between insulin sensitive and insulin resistant subjects were evaluated
using the Student's t test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical
variables. For genes analyzed by real time-PCR, significant differences between insulin
sensitive and insulin resistant groups were determined by Student's t test. The results were
considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. The correlations between subject clinical data (HOMA2IR or BMI) and characteristics of adipose histology (macrophage infiltration or adipocyte
diameter) were analyzed by Pearson's coefficient.

Results
Clinical and metabolic characteristics of the study population

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Adipose tissue samples from 20 human subjects were used in this study. Fourteen of the
twenty subjects were female and the mean age of the cohort was 42 years (Table 1). Using
HOMA2-IR analysis, we divided subjects into two groups: insulin sensitive (n=10) and
insulin resistant (n=10). Insulin resistant subjects showed significantly elevated HOMA2-IR
as compared to insulin sensitive subjects (see Methods). In addition, both fasting insulin and
fasting glucose levels tended to be higher in insulin resistant subjects. There was no
statistically significant difference in the components of the lipid profile between the two
groups, although the insulin resistant subjects tended to have higher triglyceride values.
Global gene expression profiling of adipose tissue identifies active chemokine signaling in
obese insulin resistant patients
In order to identify genes related to insulin resistance rather than obesity per se, we first
utilized cDNA microarrays to determine the gene expression profiles of 39 paired
subcutaneous and omental samples from the 20 BMI-matched subjects (one insulin resistant
subject did not have a subcutaneous sample available for microarray analysis). Using
GeneChip Expression Array Analysis and filtering parameters p-value < 0.05 and fold
change ≥ 2, we identified 37 genes differentially expressed in omental tissue of insulin
resistant subjects as compared to insulin sensitive subjects, and three genes differentially

expressed in subcutaneous tissue between the two subject groups (Table 2). In order to
elucidate the molecular functions differentially regulated in the omental adipose tissue of
our subjects, we entered the gene list into the DAVID bioinformatics database and identified
2 Gene Ontology Molecular Function gene sets as being differentially expressed between
the insulin resistant and insulin sensitive subjects (Table 3). The gene sets representing
chemokine activity and chemokine receptor binding were upregulated in omental tissue of
insulin resistant subjects and reached statistical significance using the Bonferroni correction
to address the problem of multiple comparisons. Both gene sets included the genes
chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2),
chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4) and
interleukin 8 (IL8). These five genes were studied with quantitative real-time PCR analysis
which revealed that the direction and magnitude of the differential expression in omental
tissue was consistent with the data provided by microarray analysis, thereby confirming the
computational approach (Fig 1B). These trends held up when the data were re-analyzed
using just the female patients, confirming that the observed differences were not due to
gender bias (Supplementary Figure 1).
Adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and histology

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether the differences in chemokine expression with insulin resistance were
related to changes in adipose tissue composition, we performed an immunohistochemical
analysis of omental adipose tissue samples from eleven patients which comprised a subset of
the original cohort of twenty patients. We observed strikingly larger adipocyte size and
increased macrophage infiltration associated with insulin resistance (Fig 2A,B). There was a
significant correlation between HOMA2-IR and macrophage infiltration (Fig 2C), yet,
correlation analysis of CD68 staining with BMI in the morbidly obese range showed no
association (Fig 2E). Adipocyte diameter was inversely correlated with HOMA2-IR, but not
with BMI in our obese subjects (Fig 2D,F). Thus, the striking morphological appearance and
cellular composition of the adipose tissue relates significantly to insulin resistance but not
the obese state per se in this cohort.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In this study we aimed to identify molecular pathways in adipose tissue related directly to
insulin resistance in obese individuals. By combining expression profiling with
computational approaches, we found that elevated chemokine and chemokine receptor
activity distinguishes the omental adipose tissue of insulin resistant obese patients from
omental adipose of insulin sensitive obese individuals. In addition, our histological analysis
determines that increased adipocyte size and increased macrophage infiltration of the
adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance and not simply BMI in morbidly obese
human subjects.
Both human and animal studies demonstrate that hypertrophied adipocytes secrete
chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-2 (CCL2), which is a chemoattractant that increases
macrophage infiltration7,11,21. As such, CCL2 is thought to be the primary chemokine
secreted from adipose tissue in the obese state, and responsible for adipose inflammation
leading to subsequent metabolic alterations12. However, CCL2-deficient mice do not have
diminished macrophage infiltration or improved glucose metabolism compared to control
mice22, suggesting that other chemokines may play critical a role in the adipose
inflammation associated with obesity. The increased expression of five chemokines in the
visceral adipose tissue of our insulin resistant cohort supports this theory, which has been
previously demonstrated in studies of obese subjects with lean controls23. Of note, CCL2
did not have the highest fold change of the chemokines we identified as being upregulated in
insulin resistance. Interleukin 8/CXCL8, another chemokine identified in our insulin

resistant sample, is differentially secreted by visceral adipose tissue and implicated in
coronary heart disease24. Recently, CD11c+CD206+ adipose tissue macrophages obtained
from human donor subjects were shown to display high secretion of IL825. Taken together
with our findings, we suggest IL-8 may be a determinant of obesity-related sequelae.
Enlarged adipocyte size is associated with insulin resistance26 and increased adipokine
production and secretion27,28. In our study population, insulin resistance was associated
with an increase in adipocyte size. Chemokines, secreted by hypertrophied adipocytes,
attract macrophages that can be seen dispersed throughout the tissue, or clustered around
adipocytes in “crown like structures” and secrete cytokines that contribute to the low-grade
inflammation seen in obesity. Omental fat appears to have more macrophage infiltration
than subcutaneous fat, a finding that is exaggerated by central obesity29. Our data agree with
this relationship between insulin resistance, adipocyte size and macrophage infiltration and
support the hypothesis that this relationship is not a function of overall weight, but perhaps
related to one or more other unknown factors including adipose distribution or increased
omental fat mass.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our data are consistent with previous analyses using large-scale gene expression studies
performed in the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues of lean and obese subjects.
Arner, et al showed that obesity was associated with pathways involved in immune and
defense responses12. Dolinkova, et al reported an increase in expression of proinflammatory
and adipogenic genes in obese compared to lean women13. However, in both studies, limited
information was provided regarding insulin sensitivity of the participants, so the obese group
may be heterogeneous with respect to obesity related co-morbidities. Maclaren, et al showed
that changes in expression of genes encoding proteins in the insulin signaling pathway were
greater in omental than in subcutaneous tissue, and were related to insulin resistance rather
than obesity30.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The strengths of our study consist of the inclusion of BMI-matched obese subjects with a
range of insulin sensitivity and the use of microarray data, which allows for the unbiased
analysis of the expression of multiple genes in different pathways. The use of BMI-matched
subjects reduces the influence of obesity itself as a variable in correlating insulin resistance
with altered gene expression. One may argue that the measurement of BMI may not
accurately reflect the degree of body fat content and may be strengthened by more objective
data on body fat composition or waist circumference. Recent evidence31 suggests that waist
circumference is not a useful measurement in severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40), so an abdominal
MRI would be the best way to quantify visceral adipose tissue in this population.
Acquisition of this data may have shown that our results are secondary to increased omental
fat mass in the insulin resistant cohort. Due to our limited group of surgical patients we
included both female and male subjects in both the insulin resistant and insulin sensitive
cohorts. Yet, the enrichment of genes encoding chemokines in the omental adipose tissue of
insulin resistant patients was observed even when we limited our analysis to the female
patients (Figure S1), making it unlikely that our observed differences were due to gender
bias. Our data are consistent with a growing body of evidence suggesting that adipose
inflammation plays a role in mediating the insulin resistance itself, as it is manifest in
obesity. Intact adipose tissue is comprised of a pool of heterogeneous cells (i.e. adipocytes,
preadipocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells) and future studies using isolated cell
fractions will be useful in determining which cell type is the primary source of the
inflammatory signals.

Conclusions
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We show that omental adipose chemokine expression and macrophage infiltration is
associated with insulin resistance, independent of obesity in a morbidly obese population.
This study raises the important question: why do some obese patients display such
inflammation in their omental adipose tissue, while other equally obese patients do not?
Pharmaceutical agents aimed at interrupting the chemokine pathway may be able to
diminish the metabolic sequelae associated with obesity.

Relationship between macrophage infiltration, adipocyte diameter and HOMA2-IR in
omental adipose tissue. Immunohistochemical detection of CD68+ macrophages performed
on omental adipose tissue samples obtained from obese human subjects undergoing gastric
bypass surgery. A-B. CD68 staining of omental adipose tissue from a representative insulin
sensitive (A) and insulin resistant (B) subject. Unlike in adipose tissue from insulin sensitive
subject (A) macrophages are observed throughout the tissue (arrows) and arranged in crownlike structures (arrowhead) in the insulin resistant subject (B). Sections taken at 20x
magnification. CF, Quantitative analysis of adipocyte diameter and macrophage infiltration
in adipose tissue of insulin resistant and insulin sensitive obese human subjects. Adipocyte
diameter was calculated from the perimeter measurement of 100 cells. Insulin sensitivity, as
determined by HOMA2-IR, correlates with CD68+ macrophage infiltration (C) and
adipocyte diameter (D). Body mass index (BMI) shows no correlation with macrophage
infiltration (E) or adipocyte diameter (F). Data is an average of 10 histological fields using
10X objective (C or E).
