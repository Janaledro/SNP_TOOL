Abstract

Author Manuscript

Persistent activation of the innate immune system greatly influences the risk of developing
metabolic complications associated with obesity. In this study, we explored the therapeutic
potential of the specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) resolvin D1 (RvD1) to actively promote
the resolution of inflammation in human visceral adipose tissue from obese patients. By means of
LC-MS/MS-based metabololipidomic analysis we identified unbalanced production of SPMs (i.e.
D- and E-series resolvins, protectin D1, maresin 1 and lipoxins) with respect to inflammatory lipid
mediators (i.e. leukotriene B4 and prostaglandins) in omental adipose tissue from obese patients.
In parallel, high-throughput transcriptomic analysis revealed a unique signature in this tissue
characterized by an overactivation of the interleukin (IL)-10 signaling pathway. Incubation of
inflamed obese visceral adipose tissues and human macrophages with RvD1 limited the excessive
activation of the IL-10 pathway by reducing phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of

transcription (STAT) proteins. Of interest, RvD1 blocked STAT-1 and its target inflammatory
genes (i.e. CXCL9) as well as persistent STAT3 activation without affecting the IL-10 antiinflammatory response characterized by inhibition of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8 and TNFα. Furthermore,
RvD1 promoted resolution by enhancing the expression of the IL-10-target gene heme
oxygenase-1 by mechanisms depending on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity.
Together, our data show that RvD1 can tailor the quantitative and qualitative responses of human
inflamed adipose tissue to IL-10 and provide a mechanistic basis for the immunoresolving actions
of RvD1 in this tissue. These findings may have potential therapeutic implications in obesityrelated insulin resistance and other metabolic complications.

INTRODUCTION
Author Manuscript

A chronic state of low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue is recognized as a critical factor
for the progression of metabolic complications associated with obesity, such as insulin
resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (1,2). Indeed, these obesity-related
comorbidities are closely linked to the presence of a persistent activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways in adipose tissue, which severely disrupts key metabolic
checkpoints in this tissue (1,2). Among these signals, enhanced production of proinflammatory adipokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β,
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), leptin and resistin, accompanied by a
reduction in the anti-inflammatory adipokine, adiponectin, are common findings in obese
individuals with the metabolic syndrome (3,4).

In addition to the heightened production of inflammatory mediators, obese adipose tissue
shows an intrinsic inability to resolve uncontrolled inflammation and to restore tissue
homeostasis and functionality (5). Current evidence indicates that inflammation does not
switch off in a passive manner but involves a program of unique endogenous mechanisms
and mediators that orchestrate its active resolution in a timely and effective manner (6).
Among these, lipid mediators such as lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins,
collectively known as specialized-proresolving mediators (SPM) have attracted the most
attention (7). SPM act not only as ‘braking signals’ of the persistent vicious cycle leading to
unremitting inflammation, but mainly as promoters of active resolution of inflammation.
Indeed, at the preclinical level, therapeutic administration of SPM has been shown to
promote resolution of inflamed adipose tissue and to protect mice against obesity-associated
complications such as insulin resistance and NAFLD (8–12). An interesting aspect of these
mediators is that SPM are able to take advantage of macrophage plasticity by inducing
changes in the phenotype of recruited adipose tissue macrophages toward a pro-resolution
M2 state (8,10). In addition, SPM enhance the emergence of pro-resolving macrophages
expressing low levels of CD11b and producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (13).
Moreover, SPM induce monocyte differentiation into phagocytosing macrophages,
facilitating the removal of dead or dying cells (efferocytosis) and enhancing phagocyte
efflux to drain lymph nodes in order to aid in clearing out the inflamed tissues (14,15). All
these processes are considered to positively contribute to the resolution of adipose tissue
inflammation and the prevention of metabolic syndrome in obesity.

The present study was undertaken to move forward in the concept of resolution as an active
phenomenon aimed at suppressing uncontrolled inflammation in human obese adipose
tissue. This study has three main objectives: 1) to translate the findings obtained in preclinical models to real-world human samples of adipose tissue from obese individuals; 2) to
characterize the intracellular signaling pathways by which SPM may exert pro-resolving
actions in inflamed adipose tissue in a series of mechanistic studies in human adipose tissue
and macrophages; and 3) to provide proof of concept that targeting SPM signaling pathways
is worthy of further investigation. Through experiments with the representative SPM
resolvin D1 (RvD1), here we provide evidence that SPM promote pro-resolutive responses
in inflamed human adipose tissue by interacting with the signaling pathways of IL-10 and by
modulating the archetypal anti-inflammatory response of this cytokine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study participants and sample collection

Author Manuscript

Forty-one individuals with obesity undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery and seven
patients without a history of obesity undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were
recruited from the Gastroenterology Surgery Unit of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona and
included in the study. Participants were selected according to their BMI calculated as mass/
height2 and categorized as non-obese controls (BMI < 29.9 kg/m2, n=7) and obese (BMI >
29.9 kg/m2, n=41). Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease or cancer and obese
patients with previous bariatric surgery were excluded from the study. Harvested omental
adipose tissue samples were washed twice with DPBS and minced in ≈100 mg pieces,
placed in either 10% formalin or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for
further analysis. Demographic, clinical data and drug use were collected from patients’
electronic medical records. All studies were conducted in accordance with the criteria of the
Investigation and Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clínic and written informed consent was
obtained from all participants (protocol #2012-7239).
Biochemical analyses
Serum concentrations of glucose, cholesterol, TAG, ALT and AST were determined by
standard laboratory procedures.
Immunohistochemistry analysis

Author Manuscript

The tissues were routinely fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and
sectioned into 2 μm-thick sections for CD68 immunohistochemistry with the Dako Flex
Ready-to-use monoclonal mouse anti-human CD68 antibody (Dako) and H&E counterstain
at the Pathology Department of the Hospital Clínic. For quantitative analysis, the number of
CD68-positive cells was counted in a total of 15 high-power fields (HPFs) per tissue section
under a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope) at x400 magnification, and
results were given as number of positive cells/HPF.
Adipose tissue explants and “ex vivo” incubations
human visceral adipose tissue from obese patients was collected under sterile conditions and
placed in a P100 plate with pre-warmed (37°C) DPBS containing antibiotics (penicillin (100

dissection before cutting the tissue into small pieces (60–80 mg). Explants were washed
with DPBS at 37°C by centrifugation for 1 min at 400g to remove blood cells and then
maintained overnight in culture in DMEM with L-glutamine (2 mM), antibiotics and 10%
FBS. Treatments were performed after a gentle rinse in DPBS containing penicillin and
streptomycin, in DMEM with L-glutamine, antibiotics and 1% endotoxin-free BSA-fatty
acid free (FAF) (Sigma). Protein and mRNA expression were assessed in explants incubated
with vehicle (0.01% EtOH) or RvD1 (1, 10 and 50 nM) (Cayman Chemicals) for 30 min
followed by the addition of cytokines (IL-10, 20 ng/ml; IL-1β, 25 pg/ml and IL-6, 10 ng/ml)
(R&D Systems) for 0.5, 2 and 6 h at 37°C. For experiments assessing IL-10 production,
adipose tissue was preincubated with 5 μM SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor XVI) (Merck
Millipore) in the presence of RvD1 (1, 10 and 50 nM) for 30 min before the addition of LPS
(1 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 24 h. At the end of the incubation periods, supernatants were collected
and explants were frozen in liquid nitrogen, placed into polypropylene tubes and stored at
−80°C for further analysis.
Isolation of adipocytes and stromal vascular cells (SVC)

Author Manuscript

Adipose tissue samples (3–7 g) were extensively washed with sterile DPBS containing
antibiotics to remove contaminating blood cells. The specimens were then cut carefully in
0.6–1.0 g pieces avoiding connective tissue and blood vessels. Explants were washed with
DPBS at 37°C by centrifugation for 1 min at 400g to remove blood cells. Tissue was finely
minced and placed in 5 ml of digestion buffer containing Krebs Ringer supplemented with
1.5% BSA-FAF and 2.5 mg/ml of Liberase (Roche Diagnostics) and incubated at 37°C for
45 min with gentle shaking. Tissue homogenates were filtered through a 100 μm nylon mesh
and maintained in Krebs Ringer supplemented with 1.5% BSA-FAF and 2 mM EDTA for 10
min. Floating cells (adipocytes) were collected, homogenized in 1 ml of TRizol Reagent
(Invitrogen) and stored at −80°C for futher analysis. The infranatant containing the SVC was
centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and pelleted cells were homogenized in 1 ml of TRizol
Reagent and kept at −80°C until futher analysis.
Cell culture and cell incubations

Author Manuscript

The human monocyte cell line, THP-1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured with RPMI
1640 medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Before
performing the experiments, the growth medium was exchanged for serum-free RPMI 1640
medium for 18h. In some experiments, unstimulated THP-1 cells or THP-1 cells
differentiated into macrophage-like cells by the addition of PMA (50 ng/ml) (Sigma) for 48
h were seeded (8×105–1×106) into 12- and 24-well plates, and then incubated at 37°C in
serum-free RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of vehicle (0.01% EtOH) and RvD1 (1, 10
and 50 nM) for 30 min followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of IL-10 (2, 20,
100 and 200 ng/ml), IL-6 (0.05, 10 and 20 ng/mL) and IL-1β (25 pg/ml) for 10 min. An
additional time point of 6 h was performed for IL-10 treatments. For experiments assessing
SOCS3 stabilization, THP-1 cells were pre-incubated with or without IL-10 (20 ng/ml) for
30 min before the addition of IL-6 (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 10 μM of the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem, Merck Millipore) for 5 h. To verify the effects of
MG132 in preventing the proteolytic degradation of newly synthesized SOCS3 by the

ubiquitin–proteasome system (16) aditional experiments were performed in THP-1 cells preincubated in the absence or presence of MG132 (10 μM) for 30 min before the addition of
IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 5 h. In some experiments, LPS stimulation was performed in the
presence of a mouse monoclonal anti-human IL-10 receptor (10 μg/ml) or control nonimmune mouse immunoglobin (IgG) (R&D Systems). At the end of the incubation periods,
cells and supernatants were collected for futher analysis.

Isolation of total RNA from adipose tissue, adipocytes, SVC and THP-1 cells was performed
using the TRIzol reagent. RNA concentration was assessed in a NanoDrop-1000
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies), and its integrity tested with a RNA 6000
Nano Assay in a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). cDNA synthesis from 0.5–1 μg
of total RNA was performed using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied
Biosystems). Real-time PCR analysis of SOCS1 (Hs00705164_s), SOCS3
(Hs02330328_s1), IL-1β (Hs01555410_m1), IL-8 (Hs00174103_m1), IL-6

(Hs01124251_g1) was performed in a 7900HT Fast System (Applied Biosystems) using βactin (Hs99999903_m1) as the endogenous control. PCR results were analyzed with
Sequence Detector 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantification of gene
expression was performed using the comparative Ct method. The amount of target gene,
normalized to β-actin and relative to a calibrator, was determined by the arithmetic equation
2−ΔΔCt, as described in the comparative Ct method (http://docs.appliedbiosystems.com/
pebiodocs/04303859.pdf). For the analysis of real-time PCR data from patients, a total RNA
derived from normal human adipose tissue pooled from 18 individuals (Clontech
Laboratories, Inc) was used as a calibrator.
Western blot analysis

Total protein was extracted using a lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 20 mM βglycerophosphate, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Igepal, 10% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and
150 mM NaCl for adipose tissue and a modified RIPA buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal, and 0.25% 1 mM EDTA for THP-1 cells, both supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors from Roche Diagnostics (Complete Mini and
PhosSTOP cocktails, respectively). Homogenates were incubated on ice for 10 min and
centrifuged at either 14000g, 15 min (cells) or 16000g, 40 min (tissue) at 4 °C. Total protein
(30–40 μg) from supernatants was placed in SDS-containing Laemmli sample buffer, heated
for 5 min at 95°C, and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE for 120 min at 120 V. Transfer was
performed by the iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen) onto PVDF membranes at 20 V
over 7 min, and the efficiency of the transfer was visualized by Ponceau S staining. The
membranes were then soaked for 1 h at room temperature in 0.1% T-TBS and 5% (w/v)
nonfat dry milk. Blots were washed 3 times for 5 min each with 0.1% T-TBS and
subsequently incubated overnight at 4°C with primary anti-human antibodies for HO-1,
SOCS3, phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701), phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), phospho-p38 MAPK

Thereafter, the blots were washed 3 times for 5 min each with 0.1% T-TBS containing 5%
(w/v) nonfat dry milk and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with donkey anti-rabbit
(Biolegend) or anti-mouse (Cell Signaling) HRP-linked antibody (1:2000) in 0.1% T-TBS.
Bands were visualized using the EZ-ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Biological
Industries). To assess housekeeping protein expression, membranes were reblotted overnight
at 4°C with primary rabbit anti-human GAPDH antibody (Imgenex) or β-actin HRP
conjugate (Cell Signaling) and detected and visualized as described above. Total STAT1,
STAT3, p38 MAPK, GAPDH or β-actin were used as an internal control to verify basal level
expression and equal protein loading.
High-throughput transcriptomic analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

RNA profiling was conducted in adipose tissue samples from 4 patients with morbid obesity
and 4 control subjects using the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 expression array plate
containing more than 36,000 transcripts and variants (Affymetrix, Inc.). Preparation of
cRNA probes, hybridization, and scanning of arrays were performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and carried out by the Functional Genomics Unit of IDIBAPS.
Affymetrix gene expression data were normalized with the robust multiarray algorithm using
a custom probe set definition that maps probes directly to Entrez Gene Ids
(HGU219_Hs_ENTREZG). A filtering step excluding probes not reaching a coefficient of
variation of 0.02 was employed and the total number of obtained probes was 13,928. For the
detection of differentially expressed genes, a linear model was fitted to the data and
empirical Bayes moderated statistics were calculated using the Limma package
(Bioconductor). Adjustment of p-values was done by the determination of false discovery
rates (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (17). All computations were done
using R statistical software. Genes representing a fold change of 1.5 or greater and a
moderated p-value <0.05 were considered as differentially expressed. Microarray data has
been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE7141 (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank).
Metabololipidomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)

Author Manuscript

Adipose tissues were suspended in 1.0 mL cold methanol, gently homogenized then kept on
ice for 1 h to allow for protein precipitation. Lipid mediators were profiled as described in
(18). Briefly, lipid mediators were extracted by solid phase extraction using C18 columns
and eluted using methyl formate. Fractions were then taken for LC-MS/MS-based
lipidomics using a QTrap 6500 (ABSciex) MS-MS coupled to a Shimadzu HPLC system.
Calibration curves were obtained using synthetic and authentic lipid mediators mixtures.
Linear calibration curves for each were obtained with r2 values in the range 0.98–0.99.
Quantification was carried out based on the peak area of the MRM transition and the linear
calibration curve for each compound or compounds with similar physical properties.
Luminex xMAP technology
Cytokine levels were determined in cell culture supernatants (25 μl) using a multiplexed
bead-based immunoassay Milliplex MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead
Panel (Merck Millipore) on a Luminex 100 Bioanalyzer. The readouts were analyzed with

the standard version of the Milliplex Analyst software (Merck Millipore). A five-parameter
logistic regression model was used to create standards curves (pg/mL) and to calculate the
concentration of each sample.
Measurement of IL-10 levels
Levels of IL-10 in supernatants from adipose tissue explants were determined by a specific
enzyme-linked immunoassay (Human IL-10 ELISA kit, Invitrogen).
Statistical analysis of the results was performed using the unpaired Student t test. For
multivariate statistical analysis, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was
performed using SIMCA 13.0.3 software (Umetrics) following mean centering and unit
variance scaling of lipid mediator amounts. Results were expressed as means ± SEM, and
differences were considered significant at a p value ≤ 0.05.

RESULTS

Author Manuscript

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients included in the study are shown
in Supplementary Table 1. Obese individuals had increased body weight, body mass index
(BMI) and serum triglyceride (TAG) levels and a higher incidence of hepatic steatosis
(Supplementary Table 1). There were no statistically significant differences in gender, serum
glucose, cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
levels between the two study cohorts. The obese cohort was younger than the non-obese
group (Supplementary Table 1). As typical of obesity, this cohort presented a greater
incidence of type II diabetes and hypertension and took antihypertensive (beta-blockers,
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists) and antidiabetic (metformin and
glimepiride) drugs at higher frequency than the non-obese control (CT) group.

We first performed gene expression profiling by microarray analysis of omental adipose
tissue from obese (Ob) (BMI>29.9) and non-obese CT (BMI<29.9) individuals. Highthroughput transcriptome and subsequent functional analyses identified a group of genes
associated with the inflammatory process that was differentially modulated in obesity
(Figure 1A). Among these, we found a significative up-regulated fold change in the
expression of genes involved in IL-10 signaling, including IL-10 (1.77, P<0.0005), its
receptor (IL-10RA) (1.5, P<0.05) and downstream targets such as HO-1 (2.23, P<0.05) and
CD163 (1.84, P<0.05) (Figure 1A). These changes were associated with a high
inflammatory burden (i.e. over-expression of IL-6 and IL-1β) in obese adipose tissue (Figure
1A). Over-expression of cytokines/adipokines was confirmed by real-time PCR (Figure 1B).
COX-2 was also significantly up-regulated in adipose tissue from obese subjects
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Finally, as compared to the CT group, omental adipose tissue
from Ob patients showed an increased macrophage content, as revealed by CD68
immunostaining (Figure 1C). Increased macrophage infiltration was confirmed by real-time
PCR analysis of this macrophage marker, the expression of which increased gradually in a
BMI-dependent manner (Figure 1D).
We next profiled the levels of bioactive lipid mediators in visceral adipose tissue samples by
LC-MS/MS-based metabolo-lipidomics. Human visceral adipose tissue produced the full

spectra of SPM derived from endogenous sources of DHA (i.e. D-series resolvins, protectin
D1 and maresin 1), EPA (i.e. E-series resolvins) and arachidonic acid (lipoxin (LX) A4 and
AT-LXA4). These mediators were identified in according to published criteria that include
matching retention times (Figure 2A) and at least six characteristic and diagnostic ions for
each as illustrated with results obtained for RvD1 (Figure 2B). Visceral adipose tissue also
had detectable levels of arachidonic-acid derived 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) products (i.e.
leukotriene (LT) B4 and its all-trans isomer 5(S),12(S)-dihydroxy-6,10-trans-8,14-ciseicosatetraenoic acid (5,12-diHETE), prostaglandins (PGs) (i.e. PGE2, PGD2, and PGF2α)
and thromboxane (TX) A2 (Figure 2A). Quantitation of lipid mediators in obese and nonobese adipose tissue is given in Supplementary Table 2. Notably, adipose tissue samples
from obese patients showed a reduced ratio of SPM production with respect to both 5-LO
products (i.e. LTB4 and its all-trans isomer) and PGs (Figure 2C). To further interrogate the
lipid mediator profiles obtained from obese and non-obese adipose tissue we employed data
driven modeling. Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of these lipid mediator
profiles demonstrated that profiles obtained from obese patients gave a distinct cluster in
principle component 1 (Figure 2D, left panel). The loading plot demonstrated that proresolving mediators including RvD1 and RvD5 as well as the inflammation initiating
eicosanoids LTB4 and TXB2 associate with profiles obtained from obese adipose tissues
with variable importance in projection scores > 1 whereas RvD2 and RvD3 were associated
with profiles from control patients (Figure 2D, right panel). Interestingly, multiple linear
regression analysis identified a close relationship between SPM and IL-10 and between
IL-10 and CD68 in adipose tissue (Figure 2E). SPM levels did not correlate with IL-1β and
IL-6 (Supplementary Figure 1B). On the other hand, tissue levels of LTB4 and its all-trans
isomer correlated with IL-10 and IL-1β expression (Supplementary Figure 1C), whereas
levels of PGs only correlated with IL-10 (Supplementary Figure 1D).

To understand how cytokines/adipokines influence adipose tissue inflammation and how this
can be modulated by SPM, we next performed ex vivo experiments in adipose tissue
explants from obese patients. As shown in Figure 3A, addition of recombinant human IL-10
to fat explants exerted anti-inflammatory properties by decreasing the expression of IL-6,
IL-1β, IL-8 and TNFα. Addition of IL-1β produced an opposite effect and induced the
expression of inflammatory cytokines/adipokines (Figure 3B). In contrast, obese adipose
tissue was not responsive to IL-6 stimulation (Figure 3C). On the other hand, IL-10
enhanced its own expression in adipose tissue in a statistically significant manner (Figure
3D), whereas this autoregulatory loop was not seen with IL-1β and IL-6 (data not shown).
The IL-10 positive feedback loop was also present in human THP-1 macrophages (Figure
3E). These cells were selected on the basis that they provide an optimal platform to perform
mechanistic studies in one of the predominant immune cell types present in the SVC fraction
of the adipose tissue. Indeed, as compared to adipocytes, cells of the SVC fraction were the
major contributors to cytokine/adipokine production in visceral fat from obese individuals
(Figure 3F). Another characteristic observed in obese fat explants was that IL-10 was able to
induce the expression of CD163 and HO-1, which are part of the IL-10-induced antiinflammatory response (19) (Figure 3G). HO-2 was also up-regulated by IL-10
(Supplementary Figure 2A). Moreover, the HO-1 mRNA response to IL-10 was amplified in
adipose tissue explants from obese patients incubated with RvD1 at 10 nM (Figure 3H).

Similarly, RvD1 at 1 nM amplified in an additive fashion the IL-10-induced HO-1 protein
expression after 120 min of incubation (Figure 3I). Unexpectedly, RvD1 at high
concentrations (> 10 nM) reduced HO-1 protein expression in adipose tissue explants
(Figure 3I). RvD1 did not modify CD163 expression either in resting or IL-10 treated
adipose tissue explants (Supplementary Figure 2B). The strengthening of the IL-10mediated HO-1 response induced by RvD1 was confirmed in human THP-1 macrophages
(Figure 3J).

To identify signaling events that may mediate RvD1 actions on the IL-10-induced antiinflammatory response, we next investigated the canonical IL-10/signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in obese adipose tissue. As shown in Figure
4A, human adipose tissue showed a constitutive phosphorylation on the Tyr705 residue of
STAT3, being the extent of activation significantly higher in obese individuals than in nonobese CT subjects. Consistent with the fact that IL-10 response is preserved in obese adipose
tissue, this cytokine activated STAT3Tyr phosphorylation after 120 min of stimulation
(Figure 4B). Notably, pretreatment with RvD1 at 1 nM significantly sensitized adipose tissue
to IL-10 and shifted the maximal induction of STAT3Tyr phosphorylation to the left and
upward at 30 min (Figure 4C). In contrast, RvD1 significantly reduced IL-10-induced
STAT3Tyr phosphorylation at higher concentrations (10 and 50 nM) and for longer periods of
time (120 min) (Figure 4C). Importantly, the IL-10-induced anti-inflammatory response
(characterized by inhibition of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8 and TNFα) was preserved in adipose tissue
during RvD1 treatment, and this SPM even further reduced IL-8 expression (Supplementary
Figure 2C). A concentration-dependent increase in STAT3Tyr phosphorylation in response to
IL-10 and its down-regulation by RvD1 were confirmed in human THP-1 macrophages
(Figure 4, D and E).

In addition to IL-10, other cytokines such as IL-6 use receptor-induced signaling through the
JAK/STAT3 pathway. Paradoxically, and in contrast to IL-10, IL-6 produces an opposed
transcriptional and pro-inflammatory response (20). For this reason, we next explored
whether RvD1 was able to modulate STAT3Tyr phosphorylation of obese fat explants
exposed to IL-6. Consistent with the lack of response of obese adipose tissue to IL-6, this
cytokine/adipokine was totally ineffective in inducing the phosphorylation of STAT3Tyr in
this human tissue, a response that was not modified by RvD1 (Figure 5A). Since in contrast
to IL-10, STAT3 activation by IL-6 is negatively regulated by the suppressor of cytokine
signaling 3 (SOCS3), a member of the family of SH2-containing E3 ligases (21), this lack of
effectiveness could be related to the observed SOCS3 up-regulation in obese adipose tissue
(Figure 5B). Similar up-regulation was detected in the high-throughput transcriptome
analysis (5.3 fold in obese versus control non-obese, P<0.05). Moreover, a close direct
relationship was identified between SOCS3 and IL-6 by multiple linear regression in human
adipose tissue (Supplementary Figure 2D). Given that SOCS3 as well as SOCS1 are
predominantly expressed in the SVC fraction of visceral adipose tissue from obese
individuals (Figure 5C), we performed mechanistic studies in human THP-1 cells. In these
cells and in contrast to that seen in obese adipose tissue, IL-6 produced the expected
induction in STAT3Tyr phosphorylation (Figure 5D). As a proof of concept that SOCS3 is
involved in the blunted response to IL-6, we obtained data showing that this canonical
response of IL-6 signaling disappears in the presence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor that

has the ability to stabilize SOCS3 in response to IL-6 (Figure 5, E and F). Nevertheless, the
unresponsiveness of obese adipose tissue to IL-6 could be multifactorial depending on
different mechanisms because, for instance, the expression of the IL-6 receptor and its
transactivator gp130 are significantly down-regulated in visceral adipose tissue of obese
individuals (Figure 5G). Recent studies have suggested that in addition to IL-10 and IL-6,
the STAT3 pathway is also part of the non-canonical IL-1β signaling pathway (22,23). As
shown in Figure 5, H and I, IL-1β was also able to induce STAT3Tyr phosphorylation after
30 min of incubation in visceral obese adipose tissue but not in THP-1 cells. These
responses were not significantly modified by RvD1 (Figure 5, H and I).

An excessive over-activation of the IL-10 signaling pathway during type I interferon-derived
responses can lead to the undesired activation of the STAT1 and its target inflammatory
genes (i.e. CXCL9) (24). As shown in Figure 6A, a remarkable phosphorylation of
STAT1Tyr and induction of CXCL9 was observed after incubating obese adipose tissue with
IL-10. Importantly, this IL-10-induced STAT1Tyr phosphorylation signal was repressed by
RvD1 (Figure 6B). Over-stimulation of the STAT1Tyr pathway by IL-10 was also observed
in THP-1 cells incubated with high concentrations (>100 ng/ml) of this cytokine (Figure
6C). Consistently, the expression of STAT1-dependent genes (i.e. CXCL9 and CXCL10)
was up-regulated by high IL-10 concentrations (Figure 6D). Similar to that observed in
obese adipose tissue, RvD1 attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner IL-10-induced
STAT1Tyr phosphorylation in these cells (Figure 6E).

The STAT3 signaling pathway is necessary but not sufficient for the IL-10 anti-inflammatory
response, and for instance, this cytokine can induce HO-1 expression in LPS-elicited
macrophages via a p38 MAPK pathway (25,26). In view of this, we next investigated the
impact of RvD1 on the anti-inflammatory production of IL-10 in response to LPS. As shown
in Figure 7A, LPS remarkably up-regulated IL-10, HO-1, IL-6 and IL-8 expression. Of note,
LPS-mediated HO-1 induction was blocked by the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB203580, confirming that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the production
of HO-1 (Figure 7A). Under these inflammatory conditions, RvD1 induced a further upregulation of HO-1, an effect that was also dependent on p38 MAPK signaling (Figure 7B).
Consistent with this finding, RvD1 increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in a
concentration-dependent manner, an effect that was also blocked by the selective p38 MAPK
inhibitor SB203580 (Figure 7C). In parallel with this, RvD1 enhanced IL-10 production
(Figure 7D), suggesting that this SPM modulates HO-1 in an IL-10-dependent manner.
Consistently, induction of HO-1 by RvD1 was partially blocked by a selective antibody
directed against the IL-10 receptor (Figure 7E). Interestingly, measurement of cytokine
levels in cell supernatants from these experiments in a multiplex assay revealed that RvD1 is
also able to increase in a concentration-dependent manner the secretion of IL-1β receptor
antagonist (IL-1ra), a natural inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory actions of IL-1β (27)
(Supplementary Figure 2E). The induction of IL-1ra release by RvD1 was also dependent of
p38 MAPK activity (Supplementary Figure 2E).

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study move forward the concept that SPM promote resolution and
actively suppress uncontrolled inflammation in adipose tissue from obese individuals. In
particular, the pro-resolving actions of RvD1 in this tissue are mediated through its
interaction with the pathways signaling for IL-10 and through the modulation of the
archetypal anti-inflammatory response of this cytokine. The current findings add to previous
work in pre-clinical models of obesity showing that RvD1 and other SPM attenuate adipose
tissue inflammation by reducing the production of cytokines/adipokines (i.e. TNFα, IL-6
and MCP-1) and shifting the phenotype of recruited macrophages toward the M2 proresolving state (8,10–12). Accordingly, the major novelty of the present study is the
translation of these therapeutic benefits to the clinical scenario in samples of adipose tissue
from obese individuals.

Visceral adipose tissue from obese patients showed an exaggerated expression of both
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines/adipokines. In the same direction, visceral
adipose tissue from obese patients showed increased levels of both inflammatory (LTs and
PGs) and anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving (SPM) lipid mediators. However, the ratio
between SPM production with respect to LTs and PGs was significantly reduced in adipose
tissue samples from obese individuals. This observation indicates the presence of a
remarkable deficit in SPM levels as compared to pro-inflammatory signals and the existence
of an impaired capacity of visceral adipose tissue to resolve uncontrolled inflammation in
this condition. These findings are in agreement with those previously reported in other fat
depots such as subcutaneous and perivascular fat from patients afflicted by the metabolic
syndrome (28). Since visceral adipose is recognized to be central to metabolic diseases and
to have a more negative impact on health than other fat depots (29), our data supports the
concept that persistent un-resolved inflammation in adipose tissue is one of the most
important factors driving the metabolic complications associated with obesity, including
insulin resistance and NAFLD (1,2).

Visceral adipose tissue from obese individuals appears to display a characteristic response to
the actions of cytokines/adipokines. For example, obese adipose tissue remains sensitive to
the inflammatory actions of IL-1β. Similarly, the anti-inflammatory response elicited by
IL-10, characterized by inhibition of inflammatory cytokines/adipokines such as IL-6,
IL-1β, IL-8 and TNFα, is also preserved in this tissue. In sharp contrast, obese adipose
tissue is unresponsiveness to IL-6. Moreover, in the obese adipose tissue, the signal
transduction pathways activated by these cytokines/adipokines display a disorganized
pattern. For example, STATs are the classical transcription factors transducing the signals
elicited by type I and type II cytokine receptors (30). In the case of IL-10, binding of this
cytokine to its receptor activates janus kinase (JAK) which is associated with the
cytoplasmatic domain of the receptor. The activated receptor-JAK complex then recruits and
promotes the tyrosine (Tyr) 705 phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3Tyr), leading to their
homodimerization and subsequent translocation to the nucleus where they bind to STAT3binding elements of IL-10 responsive-genes (31). The results of the current study support the
concept that STAT3 is required, but not sufficient for mediating IL-10-induced antiinflammatory responses in inflamed obese adipose tissue. In this regard, our findings

identify that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of HO-1
expression. This is in agreement with previous studies proposing p38 MAPK as the pathway
signaling the anti-inflammatory responses to IL-10 in murine macrophages (32). Moreover,
our findings identify the p38 MAPK signaling pathway as a genuine mechanism underlying
the additive anti-inflammatory actions of RvD1 and IL-10 in obese adipose tissue. This
observation is in agreement with that reported by Cooray et al (33), establishing that
phosphorylation of p38 MAPK is engaged in the pro-resolving signature of ALX activation,
the receptor mediating the actions of other SPMs such as LXA4 and annexin A1. Another
example of the peculiarities of obese adipose tissue in terms of activation of signal
transduction pathways by cytokines/adipokines is that incubation of fat explants with
recombinant IL-1β resulted in the phosphorylation of STAT3, an effect that was not
modulated by RvD1. Although other laboratories have demonstrated the activation of STAT3
in response to IL-1β (22,23), unlike IL-10 and IL-6, this is a non-canonical pathway for
IL-1β signaling. Finally, the observation that IL-10 at high concentrations induce STAT1
phosphorylation in obese adipose tissue deserves some comment. This is not surprising
because an excessive over-activation of the IL-10 signaling pathway during type I interferonderived responses can lead to the undesired activation of the STAT1 and its target
inflammatory genes (i.e. CXCL9 and CXCL10) (24). Of paramount importance is the fact
that this IL-10-induced STAT1 phosphorylation is significantly repressed by RvD1, which
indicates that in addition to promoting IL-10 anti-inflammatory response, RvD1 plays a role
as a braking signal that limits excessive over-activation of the IL-10 signaling pathways. A
schematic diagram summarizing most of the actions elicited by IL-10 in obese adipose tissue
and the modulation by RvD1 is given in Figure 8.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our study describes novel signal regulatory mechanisms for RvD1, which
culminate in promoting a more intense IL-10-induced anti-inflammatory response in
inflamed human adipose tissue. These findings are in accordance with previous studies in
other organs, tissues and cells in which RvD1 counter-regulates inflammatory signals while
promoting the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (34), thus highlighting the proresolving functions of these lipid mediators.

Figure 8. Schematic diagram of the interaction of RvD1 with the IL-10 signaling pathway

Author Manuscript

IL-10 promotes a STAT3-mediated anti-inflammatory response characterized by reduced
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased expression of anti-inflammatory
targets. Persistent activation of STAT signaling by IL-10 results in a pro-inflammatory
response characterized by the up-regulation of STAT1-dependent CXCL9 target. In these
conditions, RvD1 limits excessive overactivation of the STAT pathway while maintaining
the IL-10-induced anti-inflammatory response via positive regulation of HO-1 through the
p38 MAPK pathway. The p38 MAPK pathway also signals the actions of RvD1 on IL-1ra, a
natural inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory actions of IL-1β.
