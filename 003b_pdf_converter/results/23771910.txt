Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Early life and pre-conception environmental stimuli can affect adult health-related phenotypes.
Exercise training is an environmental stimulus affecting many systems throughout the body and
appears to alter offspring phenotypes. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of
parental exercise training, or “exercise ancestry,” on morphological and metabolic phenotypes in
two generations of mouse offspring. F0 C57BL/6 mice were exposed to voluntary exercise or
sedentary lifestyle and bred with like-exposed mates to produce an F1 generation. F1 mice of both
ancestries were sedentary and sacrificed at 8 wk or bred with littermates to produce an F2
generation, which was also sedentary and sacrificed at 8 wk. Small, but broad generation- and sexspecific effects of exercise ancestry were observed for body mass, fat and muscle mass, serum
insulin, glucose tolerance, and muscle gene expression. F1 EX females were lighter than F1 SED
females, and had lower absolute tibialis anterior and omental fat masses. Serum insulin was higher
in F1 EX females compared to F1 SED females. F2 EX females had impaired glucose tolerance
compared to F2 SED females. Analysis of skeletal muscle mRNA levels revealed several
generation- and sex-specific differences in mRNA levels for multiple genes, especially those
related to metabolic genes (e.g., F1 EX males had lower mRNA levels of Hk2, Ppard, Ppargc1α,
Adipoq, and Scd1 than F1 SED males). These results provide preliminary evidence that parental
exercise training can influence health-related phenotypes in mouse offspring.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The beneficial effects of exercise training on metabolic health are well characterized.
Among other outcomes, exercise training leads to increased mitochondrial oxidative
capacity, which may be protective against a variety of chronic diseases (Tseng et al., 1995).
In addition, exercise training improves glucose homeostasis and fat oxidation (Hoppeler &
Flück, 2003; Fluck, 2006). In contrast, lack of exercise (or sedentary lifestyle) is associated
with chronic disease development and all-cause mortality (Mokdad et al., 2004).
Mounting evidence suggests early life (even pre-conception) events can affect adult healthrelated phenotypes, such as disease risk; this is referred to as the developmental origins of
health and disease hypothesis (Gluckman & Hanson, 2006). Maternal protein restriction
results in offspring with lower birth weights and adult metabolic dysfunction (Peixoto-Silva
et al., 2011). Excess maternal caloric intake also affects offspring health, leading to excess
adiposity (Bayol et al., 2008) as well as reduced muscle force production (Bayol et al., 2009)
in exposed offspring compared to mothers consuming a normal diet. The existing literature
is primarily focused on maternal factors, however there is emerging evidence that dietary
and other environmental factors can also influence offspring health through the paternal line
(Ng et al., 2010).

Exercise training is an environmental stimulus affecting many systems throughout the body,
and it may be capable of inducing transgenerational modifications similar to these more
commonly studied nutritional interventions. The clinical literature concerning the effect of
maternal exercise on maternal, fetal, and child health has been reviewed elsewhere (Kalisiak
& Spitznagle, 2009). In summary, exercise during pregnancy appears to have beneficial
effects in the mother and fetus. Child health outcomes are less clear, with studies reporting
greater, lower, or no difference in body weight between neonates whose mothers did or did
not exercise during pregnancy (Kalisiak & Spitznagle, 2009). In those studies that observed
decreased body weight, the difference appeared to be due to a lower percent body fat (Clapp
& Capeless, 1990). The impact of maternal exercise on adult health outcomes or the impact
on multiple generations has not been studied in humans. Likewise in rodents, varying effects
of maternal exercise have been observed. Maternal treadmill running has been linked to
smaller litters in some (Treadway et al., 1986) though not all (Monteiro et al., 2010) studies,
but has not been associated with fetal or offspring body mass or length (Treadway et al.,
1986; Monteiro et al., 2010). Similarly, maternal swimming has been associated with lower
birth weight offspring in one (Pinto & Shetty, 1995) but not all studies (Treadway &
Lederman, 1986). Two recent studies documented beneficial adaptations in body
composition and glucose and insulin dynamics in the mature offspring of dams who had
access to a voluntary running wheel during the perinatal period (Carter et al., 2012a, 2012b).
To the best of our knowledge, only one study has examined the impact of maternal exercise
over multiple generations of offspring; there, maternal swimming led to low-birth-weight
pups in the first generation. This growth retardation was also observed in a second
generation of rat pups born to the offspring of exercised dams, regardless of whether the first
generation offspring were also exposed to exercise (Pinto & Shetty, 1995). Whether these
observed changes in body size and/or composition are associated with metabolic health or
function has not been elucidated. Additionally, the potential impact of paternal exercise has
not been examined.
Thus, we sought to determine how body morphology, metabolic phenotypes and skeletal
muscle gene expression are affected by exercise ancestry in multiple generations of mouse
offspring. Our aims were 1: determine body, fat, organ and skeletal muscle mass differences,
2: examine metabolic phenotypes such as glucose tolerance and circulating insulin and
lipids, and 3: determine gene expression differences by skeletal muscle microarray and

targeted gene expression analyses. We hypothesized that multiple generations of offspring
from exercise ancestry would exhibit advantageous morphological, metabolic and gene
expression phenotypes compared to offspring from a sedentary ancestry.

Methods
Ethical Approval
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health
guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
University of Maryland.
Animal Procedures

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We performed a breeding experiment including three generations of animals that were either
exposed to exercise or kept sedentary in the F0 generation. An overview of our experimental
design and timeline is provided in Figure 1. A standard diet (Purina Prolab RMH 3000, 60%
carbohydrate, 14% fat, 26% protein) and water were provided ad libitum for all generations
in all conditions. 20 male and 20 virgin female 5-wk old C57BL/6 mice were purchased
from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME); these mice made up the F0 generation.
C57BL/6 is an inbred strain of mouse that was chosen based on their propensity to perform
voluntary wheel running, their common use in research studies of exercise, nutrition,
metabolism, and gene expression, and their fecundity. Until 8 weeks of age, these animals
were kept sedentary (i.e., unexposed to voluntary running wheel; standard cage conditions)
and group-housed with same-sex mice.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

At 8 weeks of age, each sex was randomly split into two condition groups: exercise (EX)
and sedentary (SED) (n=10 per group). F0 animals were placed into standard cages (F0
SED) or in cages with computer-monitored voluntary running wheels (F0 EX). F0 mice
were housed individually in their respective cages for 10 weeks. Following this intervention
males and females from like conditions (EX or SED) were randomly paired for mating. The
F0 EX breeding pairs had continued access to the running wheel throughout the breeding
period, however running activity could not be monitored during the breeding period as there
were two mice in each cage. Males were removed after pregnancy was visually confirmed
by abdominal distention, vaginal plug and/or and body weight changes. After removal, F0
males had continued access to the running wheel (EX) or SED condition until sacrifice at 20
weeks (a total of 12 weeks of wheel access). F0 females had continued access to the running
wheel (EX) or SED condition during pregnancy and lactation and were sacrificed at 25
weeks after the F1 mice were weaned (a total of 17 weeks of wheel access). Eight of ten
breeding pairs in each condition produced viable litters. All of the F0 animals that
underwent the intervention period (EX or SED condition) were included in the F0 analyses.
The pups resulting from this original mating were designated as F1. A random group of 10
male and 10 female F1 pups from each condition (EX and SED) were designated as F1
breeders and were mated at 8 weeks with F1 littermates to produce the F2 generation. Of the
10 breeding pairs per condition, 7 F1 EX and 9 F1 SED pairs produced viable litters. The
remaining F1 pups were glucose tolerance tested and sacrificed at 8 weeks. F2 pups from
each condition were glucose tolerance tested and sacrificed at 8 weeks. Body weight was
monitored weekly for all animals. F1 and F2 offspring remained sedentary throughout the
experiment. Following weaning at 21–25 days, all F1 and F2 offspring were group-housed
with same-sex littermates. We used 1–7 offspring per litter for the 8-week analyses.
Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT)
Glucose tolerance tests were performed on all F0, F1, and F2 mice at 8 (F1 and F2
generations), 20 (F0 males), or 25 (F0 females) weeks. For F0 EX mice, the voluntary

running wheels were locked 36 hours prior to the glucose tolerance test to limit the effect of
acute exercise. All animals were fasted overnight (12 hr) prior to glucose tolerance testing.
Baseline blood glucose measurements were made and then each mouse was injected
intraperitoneally with 2.0 mg of D-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) per gram of
body mass. Blood glucose was measured 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after injection in all
animals; blood glucose was also measured 15 min after injection in F2 males and females.
Area under the curve for concentration vs. time was calculated using the linear trapezoidal
rule. Blood glucose measurements were made using a rodent-specific glucometer
(AlphaTRAK; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) on blood removed from a tail snip.
Following the glucose tolerance test, wheels were unlocked and animals were returned to ad
libitum food and water.
Tissue & Serum Collection

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Animals were euthanized 2–5 days following the glucose tolerance test. To limit the effects
of acute exercise and feeding, running wheels were locked 24 hours and animals were fasted
for 4 hours prior to euthanasia. Euthanasia was performed under isoflurance anesthesia; the
method of euthanasia was exsanguination by cardiac puncture followed by removal of the
heart. Heart, liver, omental fat, cerebellum, tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus
(EDL), soleus, plantaris, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscles were dissected, weighed,
and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C until analysis. Approximately 1
mL of blood was obtained from a cardiac puncture and allowed to coagulate. The coagulated
blood was centrifuged at 1750 × g for 15 minutes to obtain serum. Serum was removed to a
fresh tube and stored at −80°C until analysis.
Serum Measures
Serum triglyceride and glycerol were measured using the Serum Triglyceride Determination
Kit (TR0100; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Serum insulin was measured following a 4hour fast using a mouse-specific ELISA kit (80-INSMS-E01, ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem,
NH).
Tissue Preparation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The gastrocnemius muscle was chosen for analysis because it is a mixed-fiber type muscle
(Augusto et al., 2004) and therefore may be more representative of the average mouse
skeletal muscle than a predominantly fast or slow muscle. Whole gastrocnemius muscle was
powdered in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (15596-026, Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY), DNase-treated, and quantified with the NanoDrop (BioRad, Hercules, CA) spectrophotometer. Reverse transcription was performed with 1μg of
total RNA with the High-Capacity cDNA RT kit (4368813, Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY).
Microarray
Genome-wide analyses of gene expression were performed on subsets of F1 and F2 males.
Total RNA was extracted from powdered gastrocnemius muscle using the RNeasy Fibrous
Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). All samples were diluted to 98 ng/μl and
pooled by generation and condition (5 pooled samples per array). A total of 8 arrays were
performed (2 arrays each for F1 EX males, F1 SED males, F2 EX males, and F2 SED
males). Microarray experiments were performed as two-color experiments using GeneChip
Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The microarray gene
expression data were imported from the probe cell intensity CEL files and the Affymetrix
Expression Console software was used to calculate the summary measure of the probe level
data. These microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus

Gene Expression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Real-time quantitative PCR was used to assess the gene expression level of adiponectin
(Adipoq), cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (Cidec), and stearoyl-Coenzyme A
desaturase 1 (Scd1) (n=10–20 per group). Primer and probe sequences were designed for
each gene’s mRNA sequence using PrimeTime qPCR Assay designer (IDT). 18S rRNA was
used as an expression control for both real-time and gel-based PCR and did not differ
between treatment groups. RT-PCR was used to measure the expression of metabolic genes
(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha, Ppargc1a; pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4, Pdk4; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha,
delta, and gamma, Ppara, Ppard, and Pparg, aminolevulinate, delta-, synthase 1, Alas1;
hexokinase 2, Hk2; cytochrome c, somatic, Cycs; citrate synthase, Cs; and cytochrome c
oxidase subunit I, Cox1) (n=7–10 per group). Primer and probe sequences and PCR
conditions are available upon request. Products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels using
ethidium bromide. qPCR data were normalized to 18S using the −ΔCt method (Schmittgen
& Livak, 2008) and expressed as fold induction (2−ΔCt) of mRNA expression compared to
the corresponding EX group (1.0-fold induction). Relative band intensities from PCR gels
were be analyzed with NIH ImageJ software and normalized to 18s. Values are shown as
means ± standard error.
Statistics
Two-tailed t-tests were used to compare body and tissue masses, serum measures, and
IPGTT AUC between EX and SED groups within each sex and generation. A repeatedmeasures ANOVA was used to compare the IPGTT response between EX and SED groups
within each sex and generation. One- (F1 male RT-qPCR analysis) and two- (all other
analyses) tailed t-tests were used to compare gene expression between EX and SED groups
within each sex and generation using SPSS version 18. Statistical significance was accepted
at p < 0.05. A 2-stage ANOVA procedure was carried out on the 4 arrays of the F1
generation and F2 generations, respectively. Details about this procedure can be found in
Lee (Lee, 2004). Briefly, in the first-stage ANOVA, a one-way ANOVA model for EX vs.
SED ancestry was fitted on the entire dataset, resulting in normalized estimates of gene
expression centered by the ancestry factor. These normalized values were used in a secondstage ANOVA to identify which probe sets were significantly differentially expressed
between EX and SED ancestries.

Results
During the pre-breeding intervention period, F0 EX males ran an average of 6558 ± 503 m ×
24 hr−1 while F0 EX females ran a significantly greater (p < 0.05) average of 8378 ± 533 m
× 24 hr−1. Running behavior was only measured prior to mating, though the F0 EX mice had
continued access to the voluntary running wheel throughout breeding, pregnancy and
lactation. To examine the effects of parental exercise, we characterized the body mass,
various tissue masses, glucose tolerance, and serum insulin, glycerol, and triglyceride levels
in the original parent generation (F0) and F1 and F2 offspring from EX and SED ancestries.
F0 generation
Males—After the intervention period, F0 EX males weighed significantly less than F0 SED
males (p=0.024; Table 1). F0 EX males also had significantly less omental fat mass
compared to SED males (p=0.003; Table 1), a difference that was maintained after
normalizing to body mass (p=0.009; Table 2). Additionally, when normalized to body mass,

F0 EX males had greater EDL mass and lower omental fat mass compared to F0 SED males
(p=0.021 and p=0.001, respectively; Table 2). There were no other differences in organ or
tissue mass in F0 males. Baseline blood glucose and glucose tolerance was not affected by
the EX intervention in F0 males (Figure 2A).
Females—F0 female body mass was not affected by the EX intervention, but EX females
had significantly greater soleus mass and normalized soleus mass than SED females
(p=0.001 for both; Tables 1 & 2). Baseline blood glucose concentration was not affected by
the EX intervention in females. However, glucose tolerance tended to be better (p=0.051,
16.4%) in EX compared to SED females as indicated by AUC and EX females had
significantly lower (p=0.001) blood glucose 60 minutes following the glucose injection
(Figure 2B).
F1 generation
The F1 offspring sacrificed at 8 wk of age for analysis was comprised of 20 EX males, 17
SED males, 12 EX females, and 18 SED females. F1 litter size ranged from 3–9 (EX) and
4–9 (SED). The average litter size was not affected by EX (6.5 offspring/litter for F1 EX
and 6.9 offspring/litter for F1 SED, p>0.05).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Males—There were no differences in body mass in F1 male offspring at 8 weeks. F1 males
from EX parents had lower soleus, EDL, and quadriceps masses (all p < 0.05; Table 1) than
F1 males from SED parents, though only EDL mass remained significantly lower in F1 EX
males after normalizing to body mass (p=0.015, Table 2). When normalized to body mass,
F1 EX males had greater heart mass compared to F1 SED males (p=0.01, Table 2). No
differences were observed in baseline blood glucose concentration, glucose tolerance
(Figure 2C) or serum insulin, free glycerol, and triglyceride (Table 3) between EX and SED
F1 males.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Females—F1 female offspring from EX parents were significantly lighter (5%) at 8 weeks
(p=0.001; Table 1) compared to offspring from SED parents. F1 females from EX parents
also had lower TA and omental fat masses compared to F1 females from SED parents (p <
0.05; Table 1). After normalizing to body mass, the difference in TA mass was no longer
significant, but omental fat mass remained lower in F1 EX females (p=0.017; Table 2). No
differences in baseline blood glucose concentration or glucose tolerance were observed
between EX and SED in F1 females (Figure 2D), but serum insulin was significantly higher
(55%) in F1 EX females compared to SED females (p=0.008; Table 3). Serum free glycerol
and total triglyceride concentration were not affected by EX ancestry in F1 females (Table
3).
F2 generation
The F2 generation was comprised of 18 EX males, 18 SED males, 14 EX females, and 23
SED females. F2 litter size ranged from 3–7 (EX) and from 1–7 (SED). The average litter
size was not affected by EX ancestry (4.6 F2 offspring for both F2 EX and F2 SED, p>0.05).
Males—At 8 weeks, no differences in absolute or normalized body, organ, or muscle
weights were observed between F2 male offspring with EX and SED ancestries (Tables 1 &
2). No differences in baseline blood glucose concentration or glucose tolerance were
observed in F2 male offspring between EX and SED ancestries (Figure 2E). No differences
in serum insulin, free glycerol or triglycerides were observed between EX and SED F2 male
offspring (Table 3)

Females—There were no differences in body, organ, or muscle weights between F2 EX
and SED female offspring (Table 1), however after normalizing to body mass, F2 EX
females had lower soleus, EDL, and omental fat mass (p=0.003, 0.015, and 0.048,
respectively; Table 2). Baseline blood glucose concentration did not vary between EX and
SED F2 female offspring, but EX offspring exhibited slightly impaired glucose tolerance
compared to SED offspring as indicated by a larger (14%) AUC (P=0.015; Figure 2F).
Additionally, EX female offspring had significantly higher blood glucose concentration at
both 60 and 120 minutes after the glucose injection (p=0.049 and <0.001, respectively).
There were no differences in serum insulin, free glycerol, or triglyceride between EX and
SED F2 offspring (Table 3).
Gene Expression Analyses

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to broadly assess the impact of EX ancestry on muscle gene expression, we
performed a genome-wide gene expression microarray on gastrocnemius muscle of F1 and
F2 males. In F1 males, 86 targets were upregulated and 23 targets were downregulated with
EX ancestry (see Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1). In F2 males, 142 targets
were upregulated and 35 targets were downregulated with EX ancestry (see Supplementary
Figure 2, Supplementary Table 2). Examination of the differentially regulated genes
revealed three genes that have been linked to lipid metabolism: Adipoq, Cidec, and Scd1
were all downregulated in F1 EX males. We used real-time qPCR analysis of these genes to
validate the microarray findings and further examine the expression of these genes in our
remaining groups.
Real-time qPCR analysis confirmed the lower gastrocnemius expression of Adipoq and
Scd1 in F1 EX males (p < 0.05, Figure 4C) and demonstrated a tendency for lower
expression of Cidec (p = 0.06, Figure 4C). We also examined the expression level of these
genes in F0 and F2 males and found lower expression of Scd1 in F2 males with EX ancestry
compared to F2 males of SED ancestry (p=0.07; Figure 4E), but no other differences. We
also measured the gastrocnemius expression levels of these genes in all three generations of
females. Interestingly, many of the patterns observed in the males were reversed in females.
In F0 females, there was a tendency for higher expression of Adipoq and Cidec in the EX
group (p=0.06–0.09; Figure 4B). Adipoq expression was significantly higher in F1 EX
females and Scd1 expression was significantly higher in F2 EX females (Figure 4F).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further investigate processes that might contribute to some of the observed body and
tissue mass and glucose metabolism differences, we also performed targeted gene
expression analyses in gastrocnemius muscle. We examined a number of genes that have
been previously associated with acute exercise, exercise training responses or other
metabolic health outcomes (McClelland, 2004; Leick et al., 2007). These included Alas1,
Cox1, Cycs, Cs, Hk2, Pdk4, Ppara, Ppard, Pparg, and Ppargc1a. No significant differences
in expression of any of these genes were observed in F0 males. In F0 females, Pdk4
expression was significantly lower in exercised animals (Figure 3A). There was a tendency
for Pparg expression to be higher in exercised females, but this difference did not reach
statistical significance (p=0.07; Figure 3A). No expression differences were observed for
any of these genes in F1 females. F1 males with EX ancestry had significantly lower
expression levels of Hk2, Ppard, and Ppargc1a (all p<0.05; Figure 3B). Additionally, F1
males with EX ancestry tended to have lower expression levels of Cs, Ppara, and Alas1,
though these differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.06–0.09; Figure 3B). F2
males with EX ancestry had significantly higher expression levels of Cycs and significantly
lower expression levels of Cox1 and Pparg (all p<0.05; Figure 2C). F2 EX females had
significantly lower expression levels of Pparγ and significantly higher expression levels of
Ppargc1a (all p<0.05; Figure 2D). In addition, F2 females with EX ancestry tended to have

higher expression levels of Alas1, Hk2, and Ppard, though these differences did not reach
statistical significance (p=0.06–0.09; Figure 3D).

Discussion
In this study, we sought to determine the effect of EX ancestry on the morphological and
metabolic phenotypes of two generations of offspring. This study investigated the influence
of maternal and paternal EX ancestry on anatomical characteristics and metabolic
phenotypes, including skeletal muscle gene expression. Our results indicate broad effects of
EX ancestry on various offspring phenotypes, including body mass, fat and muscle mass,
fasting serum insulin, and glucose tolerance. Further, we observed effects of EX ancestry on
the expression of several gastrocnemius muscle mRNAs through two generations of
offspring.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Following the EX training period, F0 EX males were lighter with less omental fat mass and
greater normalized muscle mass than SED males. F0 EX females had greater soleus mass
than SED females but did not differ in fat or body mass. Other researchers have also
observed lower body mass in male, but not female mice after a period of voluntary exercise
(De Bono et al., 2006), though this is not universal as some have observed decreased body
mass in both sexes (Swallow et al., 2005) or no differences in either sex (Allen et al., 2001).
There were no differences in glucose tolerance in males following the exercise intervention
and a tendency for improved glucose tolerance in exercised females. Though forced exercise
can induce improvements in glucose tolerance in mice (James et al., 1983), no other studies
that we are aware of have observed an effect of voluntary exercise on glucose tolerance in
non-obese mice on standard chow. Our voluntary wheel running approach alleviates the
induction of systemic handling stress seen with forced running or swimming, however it
does not allow us to control exercise volume or intensity. We anticipated that voluntary
running wheel would be sufficient to produce significant adaptations as measurable changes
in muscle fiber type content have been observed in comparable studies in the gastrocnemius
muscle in the same mouse strain as used here (Allen et al., 2001).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

F1 females with EX ancestry were lighter than those with SED ancestry at 8 weeks of age;
no other differences in offspring body mass were observed. Maternal exercise training has
previously led to offspring with lower (Pinto & Shetty, 1995) or not different (Carter et al.,
2012a) body mass. Our study does not allow us to identify a specific mechanism leading to
lower body mass in F1 EX females because F0 dams were exposed to exercise from preconception through gestation and lactation (e.g. epigenetic, in utereo, or lactational
mechanisms). There does not appear to be a transgenerational effect (e.g., F2 offspring were
unaffected) of parental exercise on body mass at 8 weeks of age in our study. Only one other
study we are aware of has examined the effect of maternal exercise on offspring mass over
multiple generations. Pinto and Shetty (1995) found EX ancestry led to decreased body mass
in both F1 and F2 offspring; however, the exercise intervention in that study was forced
swimming, which is often questioned as a form of exercise in a rodent (Baldwin, 1985) and
may have induced an additional maternal stress independent of the exercise stimulus.
Maternal stress alone has induced both higher (Schulz et al., 2011) and lower (Patin et al.,
2002) offspring body mass in other studies.
Although we did not measure body composition, we examined individual tissue masses to
identify potential differences in organ mass in the offspring. F1 males with EX parents had
lower muscle masses than F1 males from SED parents, and F1 females from EX parents had
lower TA and omental fat mass compared to F1 females from SED parents. Recent evidence
suggests that the maternal environment can have significant effects on developmental
partitioning of muscle, adipose tissue, and connective tissue precursors (Du et al., 2011);

however, we are unable to confirm if this would explain our differences. Interestingly, F1
EX males had lower muscle masses compared to F1 SED males, however, there were no
corresponding differences in omental fat pad mass. Carter et al. (2012a) observed lower fat
mass and higher lean mass percentages in mature (39 wk) male, but not female, offspring of
exercised dams, while in a similar study, no body composition differences were observed
(Carter et al., 2012b). Though these results are not directly comparable due to the difference
in offspring age and method of body composition assessment, it is interesting that we
observed a contrasting effect, with lower fat mass in only female offspring. In the F2
offspring, EX females had lower relative muscle and omental fat pad mass compared to F2
SED females. The differential effects of EX ancestry on offspring body and tissue mass
between sexes and generations suggest the observed differences may be induced through
sex- and/or generation-specific mechanisms.

Glucose tolerance was affected only in F2 female offspring where those with EX ancestry
had slightly reduced glucose tolerance than those with SED ancestry. It is possible that the
greater fasting insulin concentration observed in F1 EX females could have led to impaired
glucose disposal and thus hyperglycemia during pregnancy if insulin resistance developed in
the F1 EX females. Mild maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy has been linked with
reduced glucose tolerance in rat offspring (Gauguier et al. 1991). Two recent studies have
examined the influence of maternal exercise on glucose tolerance in healthy animals. In
both, offspring from exercised dams had improved glucose tolerance as well as insulin
sensitivity (Carter et al., 2012a, 2012b). It is critical to note, however, that these
improvements were not observed until offspring were 31–32 weeks (Carter et al., 2012a) or
10 months of age (Carter et al., 2012b). Together with our results this indicates that while
the positive effects of exercise training on glucose tolerance may be transmittable to
offspring, they are not yet apparent at a young age.

The effects of EX and EX ancestry on gene expression were examined by a combination of
global mRNA profiling and targeted gene expression analysis of gastrocnemius muscle. Our
study is the first to examine the effect of maternal exercise or exercise ancestry on skeletal
muscle gene expression. Our microarray approach revealed a number of mRNA transcripts
were differentially expressed as a function of EX ancestry in both generations, with a greater
number of transcripts affected in the F2 compared to the F1 generation. Surprisingly, there
was no overlap in differentially expressed transcripts between F1 and F2 offspring, again
highlighting the difference between in utero versus transgenerational effects. Three of the
differentially regulated transcripts (Adipoq, Cidec, and Scd1) have previously been
associated with lipid metabolism and specifically intramuscular lipogenesis. Adipoq codes
for the adipokine adiponectin, that when secreted from adipocytes promotes fatty acid
oxidation and enhances insulin sensitivity (Tomas et al., 2002) in muscle. Adipoq mRNA is
expressed in muscle (Delaigle et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2009), but it is unclear whether the
resultant protein has similar effects to circulating adiponectin. Adipoq mRNA in muscle is
associated with greater intramuscular fat (Wang et al., 2008) and lipotoxicity (Delaigle et al.,
2006), but also enhanced insulin sensitivity (Liu et al., 2009). Cidec codes for cell deathinducing DFFA-like effector c, which promotes apoptosis (Liang et al., 2003) and is
upregulated in adipose tissue during adipogenesis (Puri et al., 2007). In muscle, Cidec
mRNA expression is associated with de novo lipogenesis (Wang et al., 2010). Scd1 codes
for steroyl-CoA desaturase-1, which enzymatically regulates the formation of
monounsaturated fatty acids within the cell (Kim et al., 2011). Scd1 mRNA expression in
muscle is associated with the increased intramuscular triglyceride concentrations observed
with both obesity (Hulver et al., 2005) and exercise training (Dobrzyn et al., 2010). These
lipogenic transcripts were downregulated in F1 EX male offspring, with a similar pattern
observed in the F0 and F2 generations. In females, we found the opposite result, an overall
tendency towards increased expression of Adipoq, Cidec, and Scd1 in EX/EX ancestry

females. Recalling that F1 EX females had less omental fat than F1 SED ancestry females
while there were no differences in fat mass in male offspring, we speculate that EX ancestry
females preferentially decreased adipose tissue lipid storage compared to SED ancestry
females while EX ancestry males preferentially decreased ectopic (including muscle) lipid
storage.

In addition to the targets identified by the microarray, we examined a number of a priori
metabolic gene expression targets. Direct exposure to EX did not lead to differences in basal
expression of the a priori metabolic genes in F0 males and only Pdk4 expression was
significantly lower in EX females. Although altered expression levels of the selected genes
have been observed following exercise in previous studies (Puntschart et al., 1995; Schmutz
et al., 2006), the lack of expression differences in our study is not surprising because
sacrifice occurred 24 hours after the last bout of wheel running and in humans, the exerciseinduced increase in transcription of some metabolic genes is transient and expression returns
to baseline by 24 hours post-exercise (Pilegaard et al., 2000). In F1 offpring, EX males
tended to have lower expression levels of Cs, Ppara, and Alas1. If these gene expression
differences reflect a more extensive effect of EX ancestry on skeletal muscle gene
expression then perhaps the morphological differences seen in the F1 EX males (smaller
soleus, EDL, and quadriceps muscle mass) can be partially explained by an impact of EX
ancestry on skeletal muscle gene expression and tissue development. Interestingly, there
were more significant effects of EX ancestry on metabolic gene expression in F2 offspring
than F1 offspring. The magnitude of the difference between EX and SED ancestries,
however, was smaller, which may explain why the differences in gene expression were not
associated with gross morphological changes in the F2 generation. Alternatively, EX may
uniquely affect skeletal muscle gene expression in the F2 offspring through the germ line
whereas the gross morphological effects observed in the F1 generation may be related to a
direct influence of exercise during the F1 in utero period.

Altered maternal nutrition and other stressors have been associated with epigenetic changes
in a number of genes and tissues, however in many of these studies the associated
physiological effects of these gene changes do not present until later in life or following a
metabolic challenge such as a high fat diet (Vickers, 2011). Similarly, the lack of overt
physiological phenotype observed in the present study may be related to the young age (8
wk) of our animals and/or their exposure to only typical cage conditions and diet. The body
composition differences between offspring of sedentary and exercised dams observed by
Carter et al. (2012a) were observed at 39–40 weeks of age. Further, the authors note that the
observed differences in glucose tolerance were not detectable until 7 months of age (Carter
et al., 2012a). Thus we believe future studies should investigate the effects of EX ancestry
on metabolic phenotypes such as glucose tolerance in animals following aging or a
metabolic challenge.
We observed differences in gene expression patterns between males and females in multiple
offspring groups. For several genes, the expression pattern was inverted between F1 males
and F2 females, with Alas1, Hk2, Ppard, and Ppargc1a all lower in EX F1 male compared to
SED while they were higher in F2 EX females compared to SED. Overall, EX ancestry led
to primarily greater mRNA expression in female offspring and lower mRNA expression in
male offspring. These patterns along with the body and tissue weight results demonstrate an
apparent sex-specific effect of EX ancestry on offspring outcomes. Sex-specific
environmental influences have been observed previously for offspring phenotypes in both
humans (Stein et al., 2007; Lumey et al., 2009) and rodents (Dunn & Bale, 2009; van Straten
et al., 2012; Carter et al., 2012a). In humans, prenatal exposure to famine was associated
with increased BMI (Stein et al., 2007) and blood lipids (Lumey et al., 2009) in women, but
not men. In mice, in utero protein restriction influenced the development of metabolic

dysfunction in female, but not male offspring (van Straten et al., 2012). Additionally,
maternal high fat diet induced greater body length in both sexes of second-generation
offspring, but higher Igf1 levels in females only (Dunn & Bale, 2009). With regard to
exercise, voluntary maternal wheel running in the perinatal period led to higher lean and
lower fat mass percentages in mature male, but not female offspring (Carter et al., 2012a).
One proposed mechanism for these sex-dependent observations is a difference in placental
function between male and female fetuses. Chronic maternal stress in mice led to sexspecific differences in placenta gene expression where male placentas had greater expression
levels of genes important to growth while female placentas were not affected (Mueller &
Bale, 2008). Several possible mechanisms could lead to this sex-specificity, such as an
effect of the environmental stimulus on early development (gametogenesis or embryonic
sexual differentiation). Alternately, the environment could interact with the offspring’s own
sex chromosomes or hormones later in development.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A critical difference between our study and the other studies of maternal exercise and
offspring phenotypes is the inbred status of the mice used in our study. The rats used in the
Pinto and Shetty (1995) study and the mice and rats used in the Carter et al. (2012a; 2012b)
studies were both from outbred lines, while we studied C57Bl/6 mice, an inbred strain.
Though there are additional confounding factors, the effect of maternal exercise in outbred
lines appears to be more dramatic than the effect of exercise ancestry observed in the present
study. Interestingly, other environmentally-induced transgenerational effects on offspring
health have also been shown to be dependent on the inbred vs. outbred status of the rodent
line used for the experiment (Skinner et al., 2010; Guerrero-Bosagna et al., 2012). GuerreroBosagna et al. (2012) found maternal vinclozolin treatment led to increased adult onset
disease in an outbred, but not an inbred mouse model. This is the only study we are aware of
to directly compare transgenerational phenotypes in an inbred and outbred mouse strain
within the same study. The mechanisms contributing to this differential response between
inbred and outbred lines of rodents have not yet been identified. However, we speculate that
the stress of continued inbreeding may modify the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for
manifestation of environmentally induced phenotypic changes, thus making the inbred
organism less susceptible to epigenetic reprogramming of the germ line in response to
environmental factors. Together these studies suggest a critical role of rodent strain when
examining the role of the environment in modifying transgenerational phenotypes.

We would like to acknowledge some limitations to our study related to the breeding and preweaning methodology. The litter sizes reported reflect those offspring that were weaned
from each breeding pair. We did not collect information on litter size, survival or body mass
prior to weaning. Additionally, we recognize that the variability in litter size and weaning
time could have affected early offspring nutrition. Overnutrition induced by culling litters
during lactation leads to neonatal overgrowth and can induce the development of obesity and
glucose intolerance (Pentinat et al., 2010) as well as a number of other cardiometabolic risk
factors (Habbout et al., 2013). As noted previously, 1–7 offspring per litter were used for
analysis in this study. The use of multiple offspring per litter was unavoidable due to sample
size limitations. However, it is important to note that the use of multiple offspring per litter
could confound the findings due to the “litter effect”, where pups within litters are more
similar to one another than pups between litters (Holson et al., 1976).
In summary, EX ancestry affects various offspring phenotypes across two generations, but
in a generation- and sex-dependent manner. We have observed effects at both the wholebody (body and tissue mass and glucose tolerance) and skeletal muscle gene expression
levels, which together reflect a broad impact of EX ancestry. This study is the first to
examine the effect of exercise ancestry on a broad range of metabolic phenotypes, however
this study is descriptive in nature and the specific mechanisms responsible for the observed

phenotypes were not elucidated. Future studies should examine the potential influences of
maternal vs. paternal exercise, and their cooperative effects. Similarly, additional work
should isolate the EX exposure to discrete phases (i.e. pre-conception, gestation, lactation)
to provide further insight into potential mechanisms.

a.

What is the central question of this study? How does parental exercise training
directly and/or transgenerationally affect offspring phenotypes over two
generations of mice?

b. What is the main finding and what is its importance? We observed preliminary
evidence that parental exercise training can influence health-related phenotypes
(e.g., body and fat mass, muscle gene expression) in mouse offspring. These
findings indicate parental exercise may be another environmental factor (like
altered nutrition) capable of influencing offspring phenotypes in adulthood.

Relative gastrocnemius muscle mRNA levels of Alas1, Cox1, Cycs, Cs, Hk2, Pdk4, Ppara,
Ppard, Pparg, and Ppargc1a determined by RT-PCR in: (A) F0 females, (B) F1 males, (C)
F2 males, and (D) F2 females. For each offspring group, only mRNA targets with p ≤ 0.10
between EX and SED ancestry are shown in the figure; no mRNA targets met this threshold
for F0 males or F1 females. Average expression level in EX was set to 1.0. Sample sizes
were n=7–10. *significantly different from EX within sex and generation (p < 0.05)
