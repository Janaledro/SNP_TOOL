routine peri-operative liver biopsies were collected, analyzed histologically, and RNA was
isolated. We collected data on overall survival and clinical and biochemical parameters and
compared these with data from propensity score-matched subjects participating in the third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). We used liver biopsies to
identify bariatric surgery patients with NASH; NHANES III participants with NASH were
identified based on a hyperechogenic liver at ultrasound and increased alanine transaminase levels.
We analyzed a 32-gene signature associated with NAFLD severity in the liver tissues collected
from 47 bariatric surgery patients with NASH, and assessed its prognostic features using nearest
template prediction and survival analysis.

Results—At baseline, the median body mass index of patients who underwent bariatric surgery
was 43.6 kg/m2; based on histologic findings, 12% had NASH and 16% had fibrosis. During a
median follow-up of 10.2 years after the surgery, 4.2% of the subjects died. In multivariable Cox
regression, the presence of NASH (hazard ratio [HR], 2.9; P=.02) and arterial hypertension (HR,
3.9; P=.02) were associated with overall mortality. When bariatric surgery patients were matched
with NHANES III participants, bariatric surgery reduced the risk of death during the follow-up
period (HR, 0.54; P=.04). However, bariatric surgery patients with NASH did not have a reduced
risk of death compared to NHANES III participants with NASH (HR, 0.90; P=.85). We identified
an expression pattern of 32 genes in liver tissues from patients with NASH that was associated
with increased risk of death in multivariable analysis (HR, 7.7; P=.045).
Conclusions—Histologically proven NASH is associated with increased risk of death within a
median follow-up of 10.2 years after bariatric surgery, compared to patients who undergo bariatric
surgery without NASH. The survival benefit of bariatric surgery in subjects with NASH may be
reduced. A 32-gene expression pattern identified NASH patients who underwent bariatric surgery
and had shorter survival times.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of over 30kg/m2, is a major public health issue
affecting 34.9% of adults in the US and costing the US economy an estimated $148 billion
in 2008, or almost 10% of total US healthcare spending1, 2. Globally, the prevalence of
overweight (BMI greater than 25kg/m2) increased from 857 million to 2.1 billion, (29% to
37% of the world population) between 1980 and 2013 3. Obesity is strongly associated with
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a clinicopathological spectrum ranging from
hepatic steatosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. NAFLD is
emerging as the most common liver disease in the Western world, with up to one third of
adults affected in the US 4, 5. The prevalence of NAFLD in the setting of morbid obesity and
bariatric surgery, ranges from 63–99% for steatosis >5%, 10–58% for NASH and 7–74% for
fibrosis depending on definition, diagnostic criteria and the distribution of risk factors in the
specific population studied 6

Bariatric surgery is now widely performed for severely obese subjects, and has been
associated with weight reduction and an improvement in obesity-related conditions
including type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia 7. Despite increasing data
from case-control or cohort studies suggesting that bariatric surgery is associated with
improved long-term survival, the mortality benefit depends on the risk-profile of the
population with one study in Veterans Affairs medical centres reporting no benefit 8–10.
Most prognostic studies in bariatric surgery-treated patients have focused on short-term
postoperative outcomes 11, 12. Baseline factors associated with long-term mortality post
bariatric surgery have not been fully established, although age, male sex, BMI over 50kg/m2,
presence of comorbid conditions (including diabetes, cardiovascular disease) and active
smoking have been proposed 9, 13, 14. In particular, despite the high prevalence of NAFLD/
NASH in this population, its relevance in long-term outcome after bariatric surgery is
unknown.

Author Manuscript

We aimed to study the prognostic relevance of histological and molecular parameters
derived from liver biopsy specimens, on overall long-term survival in a well-characterized
single-centre cohort of obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

Materials and Methods
Patient cohort (Geneva bariatric surgery cohort)

Author Manuscript

Five hundred severely obese patients consecutively underwent bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass surgery) at Geneva University Hospital, a tertiary hospital serving the area
around Geneva, Switzerland, between June 1997 and December 2004 (Geneva bariatric
surgery cohort)15. During surgery, patients underwent systematic cholecystectomy and leftlobe (segment 3) wedge-resection or needle liver biopsy. Patients were excluded from the
study if they had chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at
baseline, no available baseline liver biopsy tissue, or previous weight-losing surgery (Figure
1). Patients with significant substance abuse, including alcohol abuse (defined as more than
14 units of alcohol per week), were excluded from surgery (see Supplementary Methods for
additional details). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Geneva
University Hospital (protocol number 14–125), and the requirement for informed consent
from the patients was waived due to the retrospective nature of this study.
Outcome assessment

Author Manuscript

The main outcome of interest was overall survival. Mortality data was obtained
prospectively or, if the patient was lost to follow-up, it was assessed from the cantonal
registry of Geneva. Cause of death was extracted from electronic medical records at our
institution. Percentage excess BMI loss (EBMIL) was defined as ([preoperative BMI –
postoperative BMI] × 100) / (preoperative BMI – 25). All endpoints, assessed variables and
analyses were pre-planned (see Supplementary Methods for additional details).
Histological assessment of liver biopsy
All histological liver biopsy specimens were reviewed by an experienced liver
histopathologist (LRB) blinded to clinical data. A threshold of 5% of hepatocytes with

macrovesicular steatosis was required for the diagnosis of NAFLD. NASH was defined as an
overall pattern of histological injury based on the presence of >5% macrovesicular steatosis,
inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning and not a NAFLD activity score (NAS) cut-off
because previous reports underscore a suboptimal correlation between histological
assessment of NASH and the semiquantitative NAS16, 17. NAS was determined based on
steatosis grade, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning 16 and the fibrosis score
was assessed according to the NASH clinical research network (CRN) modified Brunt
methodology 16.
Comparison with the NHANES III cohort

Author Manuscript

To assess whether overall survival in the Geneva cohort differed to a control obese
population, we performed propensity-score matching of the Geneva cohort subjects to
subjects from the third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III) 18 and compared survival of the subjects. A subset of the NHANES III cohort, who
likely had NASH based on elevated ALT (>330 IU/L in men and >19 IU/L in women) and at
least moderate hepatic steatosis by ultrasound (834 subjects: NHANES III NASH cohort),
was propensity-score matched to the NASH subjects in the Geneva bariatric surgery cohort
(see Supplementary Methods for additional details).
Tissue processing, RNA extraction and gene expression profiling

Author Manuscript

All NASH subjects with sufficient remaining formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
hepatic tissue for RNA extraction (n=47) were included for gene expression profiling.
Briefly, total RNA was extracted from five 5-μm-thick FFPE tissue sections using the High
Pure RNA paraffin kit (Roche). Gene expression profiling was performed using 100–400ng
total RNA by using nCounter Digital Analyzer system (NanoString) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Raw transcript count data were log transformed and scaled by
geometric mean of control probe data by using NanoString normalizer module implemented
in GenePattern genomic analysis toolkit (www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/
genepattern). Gene expression dataset is available at National Center for Biotechnology
Information Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number: GSE 69248).
Statistical and bioinformatics analysis

Author Manuscript

Continuous and categorical variables were tested using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher’s
exact test, respectively. Association of the baseline variables with clinical outcomes were
evaluated using uni- and multivariable Cox regression modelling. Propensity score-matching
was performed non-parametrically using nearest-neighbour 1 to 1 matching, based on the
following variables: BMI, sex, age, presence of diabetes, arterial hypertension, level of
bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and total
cholesterol (see Supplementary Methods for additional details).
A prognostic 32-gene signature reported in our previous study 19 was used to perform
prognostic prediction by using nearest template prediction algorithm 20 implemented in
GenePattern. Gene regulatory network was identified by using Multiscale Embedded Gene
Co-expression Network Analysis (MEGENA) 21, 22. All statistical and bioinformatics

analyses were performed using GenePattern and the R statistical package version 3.1
(www.r-project.org).

Results
Patient characteristics of the Geneva cohort

Author Manuscript

Eight of the 500 consecutively enrolled subjects were excluded due to absence of liver
biopsy or prior bariatric surgery (Figure 1). Median baseline weight and BMI of the 492
patients included were 118kg and 43.6kg/m2 respectively, Table 1 summarizes other baseline
characteristics. At baseline histology (84% wedge-resection biopsy), 89% had steatosis in
more than 5% of hepatocytes, 12% had NASH and 4% had fibrosis stage 2 or greater (Table
2). Compared to non-NASH patients, patients with NASH were more likely to be male,
diabetic, hypertensive, previous or current smokers and to be older, whereas subjects with
fibrosis were more likely to be male and diabetic (Table 1).
Prospectively assessed weight and BMI was available in 81%, 67%, 53% and 34% 1, 2, 3
and 5 years after bariatric surgery, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Median weight loss
and EBMIL at 1 year after bariatric surgery were 38kg and 74% respectively, similar to
other reports and systematic reviews of bariatric surgery effectiveness7. No patient required
bariatric surgery reversal. In univariable and multivariable analysis, EBMIL greater than
50% was not associated with features at liver histology but inversely correlated to male sex
and baseline BMI greater than 45kg/m2 (Supplementary Table 2).
Overall Survival

Author Manuscript

Median follow-up of the Geneva cohort was 10.2 years (7.0–12 years). Overall, 21/492
(4.3%) individuals died during follow-up, causes of death were cerebrovascular disease in
2/21, non-hepatic neoplasia in 4/21 (all more than 5 years after bariatric surgery), sepsis in
7/21 (not at time of initial surgery), other causes in 7/21 patients (including pulmonary
embolus, suicide, accident and one cirrhosis initially attributed to alcohol liver disease but
reassessed as multifactorial aetiology due to the short history of alcohol consumption prior
to death) and 3/21 unknown. When stratified by cause of death, NASH was associated with
death from sepsis in univariable analysis along with other baseline factors (Supplementary
Table 3) whereas fibrosis had borderline significance (p=0.067). Events were too rare in the
other causes of death to test association with baseline factors.

Author Manuscript

Baseline factors associated with overall mortality in univariable survival were male sex, age
greater than 50 years, presence of diabetes, arterial hypertension, presence of histological
NASH and liver fibrosis (Table 3 and Figure 2A–B). In Cox regression multivariable
stepwise AIC model selection only NASH (hazard ratio [HR] 2.9, p=0.02) and arterial
hypertension (HR 3.9, p=0.02) were independently associated with overall mortality (Table
3). Neither liver fibrosis nor the interaction term between NASH and liver fibrosis were
associated with overall mortality in the multivariable Cox regression.
To further clarify whether metabolic cofactors were driving the association between
increased mortality and NASH, we performed a matched case-control analysis within the
Geneva cohort. We matched the 59 NASH subjects with 59 non-NASH controls for age,

presence of diabetes and arterial hypertension. This yielded 59 pairs of NASH cases and
matched non-NASH controls with identical proportions of diabetes (46%), arterial
hypertension (51%) and age greater than 50 years (34%) although, as expected, AST, ALT
and GGT were significantly elevated in the NASH group (Supplementary Table 4). Despite
matching for features of the metabolic syndrome, NASH at baseline biopsy was still
associated with increased long-term mortality (HR=8.8, 95%CI 1.1–70, p=0.04).

Author Manuscript

When comparing baseline liver histology between subjects alive and dead at end of followup, deceased subjects had a higher proportion of NASH (38% versus 11%, p=0.01), fibrosis
(38% versus 18%, p=0.045) a higher median NAS score (3 versus 2, p<0.001) and more
advanced fibrosis (p=0.03) (Supplementary Table 5). In survival analysis, individuals with a
NAS score ≥ 5 had significantly higher mortality than patients with a NAS score of ≤ 2
(p<0.001), whereas patients with fibrosis stage 1 and stage ≥ 2 had a significantly increased
mortality than patients without fibrosis (p=0.048 and p=0.005 respectively) (Figure 2C–D
and Supplementary Table 6).
Comparison with matched obese subjects in NHANES III
In order to assess the effect of bariatric surgery on the survival of obese patients, the Geneva
cohort was matched, using propensity-score matching, to 18723 subjects from the NHANES
III cohort (Figure 1: propensity-score matching #1). This yielded 335 matched pairs of
patients with similar baseline characteristics (Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Figure
1A–B). Mortality was significantly reduced in the patients undergoing bariatric surgery in
univariable and multivariable analysis (HR 0.54, p=0.035, Figure 2E, Supplementary Table
8).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To assess the potential impact of bariatric surgery on overall survival in patients with NASH,
we matched the subset of patients in the Geneva cohort with histological NASH (n=59) with
subjects from NHANES III with at least moderate steatosis on liver ultrasound and raised
ALT (Figure 1: propensity-score matching #2). In the Geneva cohort, when compared to the
histological gold standard, this surrogate marker of NASH had a sensitivity of 74%,
specificity of 96%, positive predictive value of 83% and negative predictive value of 93% for
the diagnosis of NASH. This index was confirmed to be prognostic in the Geneva cohort as
the 145 subjects with steatosis and raised ALT had increased mortality (HR 3.7, p=0.003).
This matching yielded 41 pairs of subjects with similar baseline characteristics despite
higher ferritin in the NHANES III cohort (Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Figure
2A–B). In this analysis, bariatric surgery was not significantly associated with reduced
survival (Figure 2F), whereas older age was associated with worse survival (Supplementary
Table 10).
Gene signature-based prognostication in NASH patients
We next assessed whether molecular-based risk assessment in hepatic tissue of subjects
undergoing bariatric surgery could improve risk stratification, especially in NASH patients.
Forty-seven NASH subjects had available FFPE tissue blocks for transcriptome analysis.
Median BMI and weight were 44.6kg/m2 and 125kg respectively, median NAS was 5 and
seven subjects (15%) died during follow-up (Supplementary Table 11). A previously

published 32-gene signature 19 (Supplementary Table 12) was found to be significantly
associated with NAFLD severity in a previous cohort of 72 NAFLD subjects 23
(Supplementary Figure 3). The 32-gene poor prognosis prediction was associated with
increased overall mortality in Geneva cohort NASH subjects (log-rank p=0.03). In
multivariable Cox regression modelling, age greater than 50 years (HR 14, p=0.02) and 32gene signature poor prognosis prediction (HR 9.0, p=0.045) were independently associated
with increased overall mortality (Figure 3A–B, Supplementary Table 13).

Author Manuscript

In the NASH gene expression profiles, MEGENA identified 9 distinct gene regulatory
modules (Figure 3C, Supplementary Table 14). A tightly clustered gene module (no.4) was
centred on a hub gene, epidermal growth factor (EGF), a fibrogenic and carcinogenic driver
implicated as an HCC chemoprevention target in our previous study 24, which has led to
initiation of a clinical trial of EGF receptor inhibitor, erlotinib (clinicaltrials.gov, trial
number NCT02273362). Module no.6 was enriched with TNF-α signalling via NF-κB
pathway (p<0.001), indicating presence of inflammatory pathway activation in NASHaffected liver (Supplementary Table 15). Module no.5 was enriched with collagen-encoding
genes, TGF-β target genes such as TGFB1I1, epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway
(p=0.002), as well as 2 previously published hepatic stellate cell signatures 25, 26, evidencing
activated fibrogenesis (p<0.05).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In this retrospective, single-centre cohort, we have demonstrated that presence of NASH at
baseline liver histology of severely obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery is associated
with increased long-term mortality compared to those without NASH. Of greater concern,
despite reduced overall mortality for obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery compared
to matched, non-surgical, subjects, patients with NASH at baseline did not have improved
survival after bariatric surgery. Importantly, we identified that a poor prognosis 32-gene
signature prediction 19 was associated with NAFLD severity in a previously published
cohort of 72 subjects with NAFLD 23 and could identify poor prognosis NASH subjects in
the Geneva cohort with increased long-term mortality compared to control obese NASH
subjects.

Author Manuscript

To our knowledge, our study is the first analysis of the relationship between perioperative
findings at liver biopsy and long term outcomes after bariatric surgery. Previous reports have
demonstrated that the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery are not only linked to a reduction
of body weight but also to an improvement in metabolic parameters such as type 2 diabetes,
hypertension and dyslipidaemia 7. Paired liver biopsy studies have also demonstrated a
reduction of NASH prevalence over 5 years after surgery and improvement of fibrosis 27, 28.
Nevertheless, despite these encouraging results, our data suggests that subjects with baseline
NASH have an increased mortality after bariatric surgery and their overall survival may not
improve after bariatric surgery despite no significant difference in weight loss. Further
studies will have to examine whether persistence of diabetes was associated with NASH and
long-term mortality. Interestingly, when performing a subgroup analysis on cause of death in
our cohort, NASH was associated with mortality from sepsis. This could suggest that the
association between NASH and mortality in our study captures a risk factor for non-hepatic

mortality as underlined by the finding that only one person died from liver-related cause in
our cohort. This could also explain why the association with overall mortality and NASH
seemed stronger than the association with fibrosis, as opposed to longitudinal studies in nonbariatric surgery NAFLD subjects, indicating again that NASH could be a better predictor of
overall, non-hepatic mortality whilst fibrosis may better predict liver-related mortality 29, 30.
In addition, the finding that TNF-α signalling was enriched in one of the gene regulatory
module, may suggest a link with altered intestinal permeability 31 and possibly a lack of
reversal to a more favourable metabolic profile in a subgroup of individuals captured by the
gene signature.

Author Manuscript

Potential limitations of our study include the selection of different populations for our
bariatric surgery cohort and the US-based control NHANES III cohort although we
performed careful propensity-score matching to minimize bias with well-matched major
predictors of prognosis such as age, or features of the metabolic syndrome. Although the
diagnosis of NASH could not be histologically documented in the control NHANES III
cohort due to the absence of liver biopsy, we believe that our two-tier selection of patients,
first by selecting subjects with steatosis and raised ALT then by propensity-matching these
subjects to the histologically documented Geneva cohort NASH subjects, limited potential
biases. In addition, we tested the diagnostic performance of this previously reported 32, 33
non-invasive definition of NASH in the Geneva cohort and confirmed that it was associated
with prognosis. Finally, although potential bariatric surgery in the NHANES III control
group could represent a bias, only 2.9% of adults eligible for bariatric surgery in the US
underwent the procedure between 1998 and 2006, suggesting that the impact of potential
bariatric surgery in the control NHANES III group would be relatively low 34.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, we have shown that features found at baseline liver histology predict longterm overall survival in severely obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery. Our results also
suggest that a subgroup of subjects with NASH and a poor prognosis 32-gene signature is at
particularly high risk of long-term mortality after bariatric surgery and may require specific
management and follow-up. We believe these findings also reinforce the role of systematic
perioperative liver biopsy in subjects undergoing bariatric surgery as a prognostic and
diagnostic tool. Further experimental and clinical studies will be required to characterize and
define these novel findings.
