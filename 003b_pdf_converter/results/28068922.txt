Functional changes in mRNA expression
and alternative pre-mRNA splicing
associated with the effects of nutrition on
apoptosis and spermatogenesis in the adult
testis
Yongjuan Guan1,3, Guanxiang Liang2, Graeme B. Martin1* and Le Luo Guan2*

Abstract
Background: The effects of nutrition on testis mass in the sexually mature male have long been known, however,
the cellular and molecular processes of the testis response to nutrition was not fully understood.
Methods: We tested whether the defects in spermatogenesis and increases in germ cell apoptosis in the testis that
are induced by under-nutrition are associated with changes in mRNA expression and pre-mRNA alternative splicing
using groups of 8 male sheep fed for a 10% increase or 10% decrease in body mass over 65 days.
Results: We identified 2,243 mRNAs, including TP53 and Claudin 11, that were differentially expressed in testis from
underfed and well-fed sheep (FDR < 0.1), and found that their expression changed in parallel with variations in
germ cell numbers, testis size, and spermatogenesis. Furthermore, pairs of 269 mRNAs and 48 miRNAs were
identified on the basis of target prediction. The regulatory effect of miRNAs on mRNA expression, in combination
with functional analysis, suggests that these miRNAs are involved in abnormal reproductive morphology, apoptosis
and male infertility. Nutrition did not affect the total number of alternative splicing events, but affected 206
alternative splicing events. A total of 159 genes, including CREM, SPATA6, and DDX4, were differentially spliced
between dietary treatments, with functions related to RNA splicing and spermatogenesis. In addition, three gene
modules were positively correlated with spermatogenesis-related phenotypic traits and negatively related to
apoptosis-related phenotypic traits. Among these gene modules, seven (CFLAR, PTPRC, F2R, MAP3K1, EPHA7, APP,
BCAP31) were also differentially expressed between nutritional treatments, indicating their potential as markers of
spermatogenesis or apoptosis.
Conclusions: Our findings on significant changes in mRNAs and pre-mRNA alternative splicing under-nutrition
suggest that they may partly explain the disruption of spermatogenesis and the increase germ cell apoptosis.
However, more research is required to verify their causal effects in regulating spermatogenesis and germ cell
apoptosis.

Background
The development of mature haploid spermatozoa from
diploid spermatogonial cells [1] can be affected by many
factors, including photoperiod, hormones, temperature
and nutrition. The effects of nutrition on testis mass in
the sexually mature male have long been known, as has
the direct relationship between testicular mass and
sperm production [2]. In addition, with change in testicular size, the efficiency of sperm production also
changes [3]. We have been investigating the cellular and
molecular processes of the testis response to nutrition,
and we have found that under-nutrition despaired
spermatogenesis in adult sheep [4, 5].
Within the testis, spermatogenesis is a strictly regulated
process, at both the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional level [6]. In recent years, a novel mechanism
of post-transcriptional control, mediated by microRNAs
(miRNAs), has emerged as an important regulator of
spermatogenesis [6, 7]. miRNAs are small (~22 nucleotides)
endogenous RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression
by targeting the 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) [8] and/or
coding region [9] of mRNAs. We have recently found that
the expression of a number of miRNAs is affected by nutrition in sexually mature male sheep, and most of the predicted targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs were
mainly involved in reproductive system development and
function [10]. However, the regulatory relationship between
these miRNAs and their corresponding mRNAs targets in
testis remains to be verified. We therefore decided to profile
mRNA expression in the testes of well-fed and underfed
male sheep using RNA-seq so we could explore the relationships between the miRNAs we had identified and their
putative targets.
In addition to the disruption of spermatogenesis,
under-nutrition of sexually mature male sheep increased
apoptosis in germ cells [10]. Our recent study has revealed higher levels of expression of miR-98 in underfed
sheep than in well-fed sheep [10] and this miRNA has
been reported to play a critical role in apoptosis [11].
Since the molecular mechanisms through which miRNAs regulate the expression of apoptosis-related genes
are still controversial, we decided to explore these processes further using our nutritional model.
It has also been reported that spermatogenesis and a
large number of apoptotic factors are regulated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing that generates multiple transcript species from a common mRNA precursor and
thus raises protein diversity and allows the system to
cope with the increasingly broad spectrum of functional
and behavioural complexity [12, 13]. To date, eight types
of alternative splicing have been reported: cassette exon,
alternative 5′ splice site, alternative 3′ splice site, mutually
exclusive exon, coordinates cassette exons, alternative first
exon, alternative last exon and intron retention [14]. We

therefore also tested the hypothesis that nutritional treatment will induce differences in alternative splicing, and
these changes will be related to the regulation of spermatogenesis and germ cell apoptosis in the testis.
Overall, this study used testicular tissue from underfed and well-fed sexually mature sheep to pursue four
objectives: 1) To investigate the differences of the
expression of mRNAs; 2) To evaluate the influence of
miRNAs on spermatogenesis and the expression of
apoptosis-related genes; 3) To explore the relationships
between alternative pre-mRNA splicing and spermatogenesis and apoptosis; 4) To investigate the relationships between the gene modules and spermatogenesis
and apoptosis related phenotypic traits.

Methods
The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal
Ethics Committee of the CSIRO Centre for Environment
and Life Sciences, Floreat, Western Australia (Project
No.1202).
Animals and treatments

From May to July (autumn-winter), 24 Merino male
sheep (age 24 months, body mass 65.7 ± 4.7 kg, scrotal
circumference 31.8 ± 2.5 cm) were housed in individual pens in a building with windows that allowed good
penetration of natural light at Floreat, Western
Australia. During the 3-week acclimatization period,
all sheep were fed daily with 750 g oaten chaff (8.4%
crude protein; 8.0 MJ/Kg metabolisable energy) and
200 g lupin grain (35.8% crude protein; 13.0 MJ/Kg
metabolisable energy). At the start of the treatment
period (end of May; mid-autumn), the animals were
allocated into three dietary treatment groups (high,
maintenance and low) balanced for training success to
semen collection, body mass, scrotal circumference,
temperament, poll-horn type, and sperm quality (the
percentage of live and motile sperm, sperm concentration). Animals fed their maintenance requirements
were expected to maintain constant body mass. The
high diet was designed to allow the animals to gain
10% live weight over 65 days whereas the low diet was
designed to allow 10% loss in weight. At the start of
the treatment period, individual daily allowance was
1.2 kg oaten chaff plus 0.3 kg lupin grain for the rams
in the high-diet group, 0.7 kg chaff and 0.18 kg lupin
grain for the maintenance group, and 0.51 kg chaff
and 0.13 kg lupin grain for the low-diet group. Every
week, the animals were weighed and the amount of
feed offered to each individual was adjusted to ensure
achievement of target live weight.
The data on the effects of nutritional treatments on
body mass, scrotal circumference, semen quality and

Guan et al. BMC Genomics (2017) 18:64

spermatozoal quality, Sertoli cell number and quality
were published before [4, 5]. Our previous work showed
significant differences between High diet and Low diet
in terms of the above parameters, with the values for
maintenance-fed rams being generally similar to those
for the High diet. For purposes of the current study, we
decided to perform RNA-Seq only with the two extreme
groups (testis growing versus testis shrinking) to determine the factors that contribute to the huge differences
in phenotype.
Tissue Collection and preservation

After 65 days, all male sheep were killed with intravenous overdose of sodium pentobarbitone, and the testes
were immediately removed, dissected and weighed.
Three samples were chosen from top, middle and bottom parts of both testes (~1 cm3 for each); those from
the right testis were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −80 °C for RNA isolation.
Isolation of RNA

About 1 cm3 tissues from top, middle and bottom parts
of the right testes were mixed and grinded to powder in
liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation. The trizol method
was used to isolate total RNA [15] from testis samples.
The quality and quantity of the RNA were determined
by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA) and Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Only RNA with an integrity number
(RIN) greater than 7.0 was used for further analysis.
Small RNA library sequencing and Identification
of miRNAs

The methodology details and outcomes for miRNAs
have been reported elsewhere [10].
Construction and sequencing of the RNA-seq library

Total RNA (1.0 μg each) from each sample was used to
construct RNA-seq libraries with a unique index using
the TruSeq mRNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina,
San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was performed
for library quantification using the StepOnePlus™ RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA)
and KAPA SYBR Fast ABI Prism qPCR kit (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA). Individual libraries were then
pooled for sequencing at Génome Québec (Montréal,
Canada) using the HiSeq 2000 system (Illumina). Sequencing was performed as 100 bp paired-end reads. All reads
were de-multiplexed according to their index sequences
with CASAVA version 1.8 (Illumina) and reads that did
not pass the Illumina chastity filter were discarded.

Mapping and annotation of RNA-seq reads

RNA-seq reads were aligned to the ovine genome (OAR
3.1) using Tophat 2.0.10 with default parameters [16].
Each BAM file obtained from TopHat2 and the GTF file
obtained from ENSEMBL (v75.30) were used in the htseqcount (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/)
to determine the number of reads mapped to each gene.
Identification of differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs

Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were investigated
with the bioinformatics tool, edgeR that utilizes a negative binomial distribution to model sequencing data [17].
The expression of mRNAs in each library was normalized to counts per million reads (CPM) with the formula: CPM = (reads number/total reads number per
library) × 1,000,000. mRNAs with CPM > 5 in at least
50% of the samples were subjected to DE analysis. Fold
changes were defined as ratios of arithmetic means of
CPM within each comparison group. Significant DE
mRNAs were determined by an adjusted P value (False
discovery rate, FDR < 0.1) based on Benjamini and
Hochberg multiple testing correction [18] as well as fold
change > 1.5 [19].

Validation of mRNA expression using RT-qPCR

RT-qPCR was performed using SYBR Green (Fast SYBR®
Green Master Mix; Applied Biosystems) to validate mRNA
expression of six differentially expressed genes: PIWIL1,
SPATA4, INHBA, FOXO3, PTEN, CYP51A1. Oligonucleotide primer sequences for these genes were designed using
NCBI primer blast (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index.cgi?LINK_LOC=BlastHome)
and
the
primer for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) was obtained from a published source (Table 1).
Total RNA (1 μg) from each sample was treated with
DNAase I (Invitrogen), and reverse-transcribed to cDNA
using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase following the
manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Fluorescence signal
was detected with StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). In total, each reaction contained
10 μl Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems),
1 μl of forward primer (20 pmol/μl), 1 μl of reverse primer
(20 pmol/μl), 7 μl nuclease-free water, and 1 μl cDNA template. Samples were measured in triplicate using the following protocol: 95 °C for 10 min for initial denaturation and
then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, followed by annealing/extension for 30 s at 60 °C. Analysis of melting curves was
used to monitor PCR product purity. Amplification of a
single PCR product was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing (data not shown). One-way
ANOVA was used to compare the groups, and P < 0.05 was
considered significant. Data are expressed as Mean ± SEM.

Construction of miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships

The results for miRNAs were all obtained from a previous
study using the same samples [10]. The predicted regulatory relationships between differentially expressed miRNAs and differentially expressed mRNAs were identified
on the basis of two criteria as suggested by previous studies [20, 21]: negative correlation and computational target
prediction. Genes targeted by miRNAs were predicted by
TargetScan Release 6.0 (http://www.targetscan.org/)
and miRanda (http://www.microrna.org/microrna/
home.do). Target genes predicted by both TargetScan
(default parameters) and miRanda (total score > 145,
total energy < −10 kcal/mol) were used for further analysis [22]. Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient (R)
was computed for each miRNA and their predicted
target genes, and multiple testing corrections were
done by calculating FDR. Significant miRNA-mRNA
pairs were defined as R < −0.9 and FDR < 0.1.

KEGG pathways were declared at P < 0.05 and molecule
number > 2.
Identification and annotation of alternative splicing (AS)
events

TopHat2 was used to predict the splice junctions (options: −a 19, −g 1, −-max-intron-length 17325, and
–min-intron-length 81). A total of 15 million reads
were randomly selected from each sample for analysis
to make sure that the comparison was at the same
level [14]. JuncBASE was used to annotate all AS
events (cassette exons, alternative 5′ splice site, alternative 3′ splice site, mutually exclusive exons, coordinate cassette exons, alternative first exons, alternative
last exons, and intron retention) and calculate the Percentage Spliced Index (PSI) [24]. Splicing analysis was
performed for events that had at least 20 reads and the
PSI differences (ΔPSI) are higher than 10% [25].

Functional analysis for DE mRNAs

The identities of the DE mRNAs in the miRNA-mRNA
regulatory relationships were uploaded into IPA software
(Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com) to detect the
top functions. A threshold of P < 0.01 was applied to enrich significant biological functions. The IPA regulation
z-score algorithm was used to predict the direction of
change for a given function (increase or decrease), with a
z-score > 2 suggesting a significant increase whereas a zscore < −2 suggesting a significant decrease. The GO
terms were defined and the KEGG pathways were
enriched using Database for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) [23]. For each analysis, the functional annotation
clustering option was used and significant GO terms and

The relationship between gene modules with sheep
phenotypic traits

A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed
for all samples using the WGCNA package in R to analyse the expressed mRNAs (CPM > 1 in at least 8 samples) [26]. Briefly, a matrix of pairwise correlations
between all pairs of genes across all samples was constructed. An adjacency matrix was then calculated, using
the correlation matrix of the expression sets, and transformed into a topological overlap matrix that was then
used to derive a distance matrix of hierarchical clustering. Finally, the mRNAs were assigned into different
modules based on hierarchical clustering. Modules with
eigengenes (defined as the first principal component of

Guan et al. BMC Genomics (2017) 18:64

each module and considered as a representative of the
gene expression profiles in that module) that were highly
correlated were then merged. All these steps were performed using the ‘blockwiseModules’ function in the
WGCNA package, using the major parameters described
previously [27]. The correlations were calculated for the
relationships between module eigengenes and phenotypes
(testis weight, sperm number per testis, tubule diameter,
seminiferous epithelium volume, change of scrotal circumference, apoptotic cells/tubule; Additional file 1: Table S1).

Results
High Quality RNA-seq data were obtained from all samples

More than 350 million sequenced paired-end reads were
obtained from 16 libraries, of which an average of 76%
could be mapped to OAR3.1 (http://www.livestockgenomics.csiro.au/). The genomics region of reads, the
RNA-seq 3′/5′ bias and the sequencing depth were analysed to evaluate the quality of the RNA-seq data.
Around 50% of the reads were derived from exonic regions, while around 20% were derived from intergenic or
intronic regions (Fig. 1a and b). In general, the coverage
of reads along each transcript revealed no obvious 3′/5′
bias (Fig. 1c). As can be seen in Fig. 1d, the number of
transcripts detected increased as the number of the

Page 5 of 12

sequencing reads increased. Finally, analysis of the sequencing coverage along each chromosome showed extensive transcriptional activity for the entire genome
(Additional file 2: Figure S1).
Profile of mRNAs in sheep testis

An average of 13,980,416 (SD = 2,930,788) reads from
high diet and 11,014,809 (SD = 2,524,631) from low
diet were mapped to Ensembl gene annotation database (P < 0.05). A total of 13,859 genes were detected
in testicular tissue from the low diet group, compared
to 14,561 from the high diet group. In total, 11,748
genes were expressed in all 16 animals. The most
abundant transcript (~2% of total reads) was from the
7SK gene, a small nuclear RNA involved in pre-mRNA
splicing and processing. Functional analysis with DAVID software revealed that the most highly expressed
3,000 genes were mainly related to cell cycles, protein
catabolic processes, and spermatogenesis (Table 2).
Only genes (14,385) that were expressed in at least 8
libraries were used for further analysis.
Effects of nutrition on mRNA expression

In total, 2,243 mRNAs were found to be differentially
expressed (DE) when comparing underfed with well-fed

male sheep (Additional file 3: Table S2), of which 1,081
were expressed more in underfed than well-fed sheep
(eg, TP53 and Claudin 11) and 1,162 were expressed less
in underfed than well-fed sheep (eg, CYP51A1 and
SPATA4). IPA analysis revealed that the functions of

most of the DE mRNAs are related to quantity of germ
cells, testis size, quantity of Sertoli cells, and quantity of
connective tissue cells (Fig. 2). We considered genes that
were related to more than one function may be more
important, such as FOXO3, PTEN, CYP51A1, INHBA
and SPATA4. Therefore, they were selected for further
RT-qPCR validation analysis. Further functional analysis
using DAVID, produced largely the same outcome, indicating that most common functions of DE mRNAs to be in
the cell cycle (n = 116), spermatid development (n = 16),
spermatogenesis (n = 48), and DNA replication (n = 18)
(Additional file 4: Table S3). Importantly, one gene, PIWIL1
(MIWI), were associated with all of these functions.
RT-qPCR validation of differentially expressed genes

Six mRNAs were selected from the DE mRNAs and the
RT-qPCR results were consistent with the sequencing
data for all of them. For example, both the sequencing
data and the RT-qPCR results showed that PIWIL1 was
expressed at a lower level in underfed males than in
well-fed males (Additional file 5: Figure S2). In addition,
the expression of INHBA was down regulated in well-fed
male sheep (Additional file 5: Figure S2).
The relationship between gene modules with sheep
phenotypic traits

A total of 15 modules were obtained using WGCNA
analysis, of which three (Modules 7, 9 and 10) were of
interest because the relationships were strong (correlation coefficient > ± 0.5; P < 0.01). These modules were

negatively correlated with testis weight, tubule diameter,
seminiferous epithelium volume and change in scrotal
circumference, and positively correlated with apoptotic
cells/tubule. Among the 15 modules, only Module 11
was correlated with sperm number per testis (r = 0.56,
P = 0.02; Fig. 3).

Functional analysis for the genes in Modules 7, 9 and 10

Functional analysis suggested that genes in Modules 7
and 9 were associated with both spermatogenesis and
apoptosis, but genes in Module 10 were only related to
apoptosis. Specifically, in Module 7, 35 genes were related to spermatogenesis whereas 46 genes were associated with apoptosis. Six genes (NFKBIL1, XRCC5,
ERCC1, APP, BCAP31, RRAGA) were related to both
spermatogenesis and apoptosis. For Module 9, eight
genes (RXFP1, ITCH, ITGB1, XHD, TAF7L, WNT2,
SPIN1, LNPEP) were associated with spermatogenesis,
whereas 16 genes (CFLAR, TAF9B, CCK, VAV3, NR3C1,
CDH13, CROP, CDKN1B, PTPRC, ATP7A, RTN3,
HSPD1, ITM2B, F2R, MAP3K1, RAD21) were associated
with apoptosis, but no genes were common to spermatogenesis and apoptosis. For Module 10, four genes
(EPHA7, SCIN, NGFRAP1 and MAP3K7) were related to
apoptosis. Interestingly, of all the genes mentioned
above, seven (APP, BCAP31, CFLAR, PTPRC, F2R,
MAP3K1and EPHA7) were differentially expressed between

nutritional treatments, indicating their pivotal roles in
reproduction or apoptosis.

miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships

Putative miRNA-mRNA pairs were identified on the basis
of target prediction and the negative regulatory effect of
miRNAs on the expression levels of their target genes. A
total of 940 miRNA-mRNA pairs (48 miRNAs, 269
mRNAs) were identified (Additional file 6: Table S4).
Among these pairs, oar-novel-miR-33 and oar-novelmiR-31 paired with the highest number of mRNAs:
oar-novel-miR-33 paired with 68 mRNAs and oarnovel-miR-31 paired with 52 mRNAs (Additional file 7:
Figure S3). IPA analysis indicated that the mRNAs in
the negative pairs were mainly involved with
organization of cytoplasm, cell morphology, abnormal
morphology of the reproductive system, cell death and
male infertility (Fig. 4a). In addition, these mRNAs were
also involved in 76 signalling pathways, of which Sertoli
cell-Sertoli cell junction signalling, germ cell-Sertoli cell
junction signalling, androgen signalling, and apoptosis
signalling were among the 15 most relevant (Fig. 4b).
FOXO3 and PTEN were related to more than 8 functions out of 15 most common functions, we assumed
these two genes may be crucial for testes function,
therefore, they were selected for RT-qPCR validation.
The expression of FOXO3 was higher in well-fed sheep

Identification of alternative splicing events

Effects of nutrition on alternative splicing

We initially obtained 940,607 junctions from the 16
RNA-seq libraries with the Tophat2 software. Totally,
6376 alternative splicing events (ΔPSI > 10% in at least
one library and at least 20 reads mapped) were identified
from these junctions (Additional file 8: Table S5).
Among these alternative splicing events, 4,820 (75.6%)
were previously annotated as known alternative splicing
events in the Ensembl Database, which can be mapped
to 2288 unique genes. Eight types of alternative splicing
events were identified, including 1,131 cassette exons,
645 alternative 5′ splice sites, 578 alternative 3′ splice
sites, 17 mutually exclusive exons, 86 coordinate cassette

We found 2551 ± 189 (Mean ± SEM) alternative splicing
events in the High Diet group and 2455 ± 126 alternative
splicing events in the Low Diet group (not significant).
There was no difference as for the total number of each
type of alternative splicing event between two groups
(Fig. 5). PSI values from each diet group were used to
test the differentially spliced genes between treatments,
resulting 206 differentially spliced isoforms (21 alternative 3′ splice sites, 23 alternative 5′ splice sites, 34
alternative first exon, 17 alternative last exon, 86 cassette, 7 coordinate cassette exon, 8 intron retention

(n = 8). Most common alternative splicing events were cassette exon, intron retention, alternative first exon and alternative last exon. On the other
hand, four types were not as common, they were alternative 3′ splice site, mutually exclusive exons, alternative 5′ splice site, coordinate cassette exons

spliced isoforms were mapped to 159 known unique
genes, and DAVID functional analysis revealed the
most common functions of these genes were related to
RNA splicing and spermatogenesis (Fig. 6).

Discussion
This study appears to be the first to profile the whole
transcriptome in sheep testis, to construct the regulatory

alternative splicing events in testis from sheep fed a high diet or a
low diet. P value indicates the relevance of the function (lower
value means greater relevance)

relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs in testis, to
explore the relationships between pre-mRNA alternative
splicing and testis function, and to link the gene modules with phenotypic traits related to spermatogenesis
and apoptosis. In the context of an experimental model
of reversible testis growth in the sexually mature male,
we have been able to identify mRNAs that are associated
with testis function and, more importantly, apoptosis in
germ cells. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the decline in spermatogenesis and increase in
germ cell apoptosis induced by under-nutrition in the
sexually mature male sheep are, at least, partially due to
changes in mRNA expression and pre-mRNA alternative
splicing.
We found over 2,000 mRNAs that were differentially
expressed between treatments, with over 1,000 mRNAs,
including TP53 and Claudin 11, that were more highly
expressed in underfed than in well-fed sheep. This result
supports our previous observations based on qPCR [5].
A high level of TP53 indicates more cells going through
apoptosis [28], and this result is in agreement with our
previous finding-more TUNEL positive cells were observed in testes from underfed than in well-fed sheep
[10], so we conclude that under-nutrition increases
apoptosis in germ cells. On the other hand, Claudin-11
is a tight junction protein expressed in Sertoli cells and
rarely in other cell types in the testis [29] and plays a
central role in the formation of tight junctions [30, 31].

Guan et al. BMC Genomics (2017) 18:64

In testicular tissue from underfed sheep, increased expression of Claudin 11 and disorganization of Claudin
11 protein strongly indicate the impairment of tight
junctions [5]. In addition, in the present study, over
1000 mRNAs showed lower expression in underfed than
in well-fed sheep, including CYP51A1 and SPATA4.
CYP51A1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 family
and is expressed strongly by germ cells [32], illustrating
its crucial role in spermatogenesis. Therefore, the lower
level of CYP51A1 expression in underfed sheep is coherent with the decrease in numbers of germ cells and defective spermatogenesis caused by undernutrition [10].
SPATA4 has also been reported to be testis-specific and
associated with spermatogenesis, and involved in maintaining spermatogenesis [33]. Therefore, the reduced expression of SPATA4 in underfed sheep is also consistent
with compromised spermatogenesis with under-nutrition.
The functional analysis using IPA revealed that, for
mRNAs that are differentially expressed between nutritional treatments, the most common functions are quantity of germ cells, testis size, quantity of Sertoli cells and
quantity of connective tissue cells. Thus, the differentially expressed transcriptomes are consistent with the
reductions of testis mass and sperm production in
underfed rams [10]. Among all the genes that were related to these functions, we considered the genes that
were related to more than one function may be more
important, such as IGF1R, INHBA, TP53. In the testes of
adult mice lacking IGF1R in their Sertoli cells, there is a
reduction in testis size and daily sperm production [34],
indicating a role for IGF1R in control of sperm production by Sertoli cells. A protein product of the INHBA
gene, activin A, is an important regulator of testicular
cell proliferation [35]. As indicated above, TP53 regulates
spermatogenesis by inducing apoptosis [36]. We propose
that, the expression of IGF1R, INHBA and TP53 may be
used as biomarkers of sperm production.
To further investigate the crucial genes in spermatogenesis and apoptosis, we looked at the relationships
between these phenotypes and the gene modules that
we discovered in the testis. We found five genes
(CFLAR, PTPRC, F2R, MAP3K1, EPHA7) that appear
to be crucial for apoptosis and two genes (APP and
BCAP31) related to both apoptosis and spermatogenesis. More importantly, all seven of these genes were
differentially expressed between nutritional treatments,
suggesting that they played pivotal roles in the control
of testis function. These conclusions are supported by
previous studies. For example, CFLAR is involved in inhibition of the death receptor-activated pathway [37];
MAP3K1 has both anti- and pro-apoptotic functions
[38]; EPHRINA5-EPHA7 complex induces apoptosis
through TNFR1 [39]. Therefore, these seven genes are
potential biomarkers of spermatogenesis and apoptosis.

Interestingly, the changes in these genes were associated with change in testis mass, raising the possibility
that factors associated with change in testicular tissue,
rather than direct effects of nutritional treatments on
testicular tissue, are responsible for changes in spermatogenesis and apoptosis [5, 10]. If this were to be the
case, then the relationships between gene modules and
phenotypes observed in the present study could be applied more generally to other factors that can cause
changes in the testis mass, such as photoperiod, stress
and temperament, or physical fitness.
In addition, this study further identified miRNA-RNA
relationships which may regulate the above altered expression events. Of particular importance are oar-novelmiR-33 and oar-novel-miR-31 because they paired with
the greatest number of mRNAs, indicating a crucial role
in testis function. Novel-miR-33 is homologous to miR296 that is specific to embryonic stem cells and has been
reported to be highly conserved between species [40]. So
far, there is no direct evidence for a role for miR-296 in
testis function. However, one study proved that miR-296
was more highly expressed in mature testis than in immature testis, indicating a pivotal role in spermatogenesis in the adult. In addition, miR-296 was also defined
as anti-apoptotic [41]. Therefore, the reduced expression
of novel-miR-33 (miR-296) in underfed sheep [10] illustrates decreased testis function and increased cell apoptosis. By contrast, novel-miR-31 is homologous with
miR-34 which has been shown to enhance germ cell
phenotype during the late stages of spermatogenesis in
other species [42]. In the current study, therefore, the
lower level of novel-miR-31 in underfed sheep is coherent with the loss of germ cell function [10].
Nutritional treatment did not affect the total number
of alternative splicing junctions, in contrast with some
previous reports of nutritional effects on other biological
processes [43, 44]. The lack of effect of nutritional treatment on the total number of alternative splicing junctions suggests that alternative splicing is a fine-tuner in
the testis that stabilizes testis function, as suggested for
other tissues [45, 46]. However, with respect to specific
genes, we found 159 that were differentially spliced between high diet and low diet groups. Functional analysis
of these genes indicated roles in RNA splicing and
spermatogenesis, and suggests that nutrition affects
spermatogenesis by changing pre-mRNA splicing. For
example, the alternative splicing event for CREM (cAMP
response element modulator) is alternative last exon. It
has been reported that CREM mRNA exhibits a remarkable array of alternative splice variants [47]. For example,
during male meiosis, the inactive CREM variant is
switched to active CREM variant (by incorporation of
transactivating domains) directed by alternative splicing.
Therefore, in the mature male sheep, it is possible that

Guan et al. BMC Genomics (2017) 18:64

nutrition affects the number of active CREM isoforms,
potentially explaining the disruption of spermatogenesis
in underfed sheep. Future studies on verification of alternative splicing events genes related to spermatogenesis
detected by RNA-seq using qPCR and how such changes
affect the activity, possibly involving construction of a
shortened ‘minigene’ containing the regulated exons and
splicing signals [48], will be required to better understand this process. In addition, it is essential to determine whether the changes in splicing can affect protein
expression.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have identified two molecular mechanisms that could explain the effect of nutrition on
spermatogenesis and germ cell apoptosis in the adult
male: 1) nutrition-induced changes in the expression of
mRNAs in sheep testis, the functions of the differentially
expressed mRNAs are mainly related to spermatogenesis
and germ cell apoptosis, an important regulator in these
processes are the regulatory relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs; 2) nutritional treatment causes differences in pre-mRNA alternative splicing, and these
changes are closely involved in spermatogenesis and
germ cell apoptosis in testis. Some differentially spliced
genes (CREM and DDX4), and testis phenotype related
genes (CFLAR, PTPRC, F2R, MAP3K1, EPHA7, APP
and BCAP31) should be able to work as potential biomarkers for spermatogenesis and apoptosis. To make
the study move forward, confirming the predicted functions of these genes using in vivo and in vitro experiments are required.
