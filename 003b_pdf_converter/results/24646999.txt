Abstract
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reproducibly associated variants within introns of
FTO with increased risk for obesity and type-2 diabetes (T2D) 1–3. While the molecular
mechanisms linking these noncoding variants with obesity are not immediately obvious,
subsequent studies in mice demonstrated that FTO expression levels influence body mass and
composition phenotypes 4–6. Yet, no direct connection between the obesity-associated variants and
FTO expression or function has been made 7–9. Here, we show that the obesity-associated
noncoding sequences within FTO are functionally connected, at megabase distances, with the

homeobox gene IRX3. The obesity-associated FTO region directly interacts with the promoters of
IRX3 as well as FTO in the human, mouse, and zebrafish genomes. Furthermore, long-range
enhancers within this region recapitulate aspects of IRX3 expression, suggesting that the obesityassociated interval belongs to the regulatory landscape of IRX3. Supporting this, obesityassociated SNPs are associated with expression of IRX3, but not FTO, in human brains. Directly
linking IRX3 expression with regulation of body mass and composition, Irx3-deficient mice
exhibit a 25–30% reduction in body weight, primarily through the loss of fat mass and increase in
basal metabolic rate with browning of white adipose tissue. Furthermore, hypothalamic expression
of a dominant negative form of Irx3 reproduces the metabolic phenotypes of Irx3-deficient mice.
Our data posit that IRX3 is a functional long-range target of obesity-associated variants within
FTO, and represents a novel determinant of body mass and composition.

Noncoding variation in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a 47 kb region of
high linkage disequilibrium (LD) in introns 1 and 2 of FTO remains the strongest genetic
association with risk to polygenic obesity in humans 1–4. Individuals homozygous for risk
alleles of the associated SNPs weigh approximately 3 kilograms more than individuals
homozygous for non-risk alleles, underscoring the significant phenotypic impact of these
common variants 2. Multiple follow-up studies directly implicated FTO as a gene
controlling body mass and composition. Null Fto alleles in mice result in lean phenotypes,
with reciprocal models overexpressing FTO displaying increased body weight 4–6. Lacking,
however, is direct evidence that enhancers within the obesity-associated FTO introns are
connected with regulation of FTO expression. Toward that end, expression quantitative trait
locus (eQTL) analyses have systematically failed to show association between the obesityassociated SNPs and FTO expression in human tissues 7–9.

To directly chart the cis-regulatory circuitry within the FTO locus, we used circular
chromosome conformation capture followed by high throughput sequencing (4C-seq). We
carried out 4C-seq in whole mouse embryos (E9.5) and in adult (8 weeks) mouse brains,
since previous work suggest that brain FTO expression modulates metabolic
parameters 6, 10. We profiled the genomic interactions with promoters of genes located
within a megabase window around the obesity-associated SNPs (mm9, chr8:93,725,000–
94,725,000), including Fto and Rpgrip1l, and Irx3, a half-megabase downstream. The
difference in interaction patterns among genes was striking (Fig. 1a). The Fto promoter
chiefly participates in genomic interactions proximal to the gene promoter. While in mouse
embryos these interactions include the obesity-associated intronic region (Fig. 1b), no such
interactions are detected in adult mouse brains (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Table 1). In marked contrast, the promoter of Irx3 participates in numerous long-range
interactions across a broad genomic region encompassing nearly 2 megabases, including
robust interactions with the obesity-associated interval within FTO (Fig. 1a). We confirmed
these interactions between Irx3 and the Fto obesity-associated region using chromatin
conformation capture (3C) in adult mouse brains (Extended Data Fig. 2c). These data
suggest the obesity-associated interval is likely part of the regulatory landscape of Irx3. We
next inferred that the long-range interactions between the obesity-associated FTO intron and
IRX3 represent a conserved feature in vertebrate genomes. Inspecting the human ENCODE
dataset, we observe that MCF-7 cells display the same pattern of long-range looping

between the obesity-associated interval and IRX3, but not FTO, assayed by ChIA-PET
(Extended Data Fig. 2a). This is further corroborated by recent HiC data in human
fibroblasts11 (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We also observed a similar pattern of chromatin
interactions in zebrafish embryos, assayed by 4C-Seq (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Together,
these data posit that the obesity-associated FTO intron is mediating functional interactions
with IRX3 in the human, mouse, and zebrafish genomes.

Having uncovered evidence of direct looping between FTO intronic regions and IRX3, we
next showed that enhancers within the obesity-associated interval possess functional
characteristics compatible with IRX3 expression. We observed that the degree of
evolutionary conservation in noncoding sequences of the FTO-IRX locus (chr16:53731249–
54975288) places it on the top 2% of similarly-sized genomic intervals, suggesting the
presence of many functional noncoding elements spread over the region (see Methods).
More specifically, ENCODE data suggest that the 47-kb obesity-associated interval is
fraught with cis-regulatory elements, evidenced by an abundance of enhancer-associated
chromatin marks, DNase hypersensitive sites, and transcription factor binding events across
this genomic region (Fig. 1b). We tested three human DNA fragments from the 47-kb
obesity-associated region for their putative enhancer properties using an in vivo mouse
reporter assay. These fragments overlap enhancer-like chromatin marks in multiple cell
lines. All three fragments displayed enhancer activity in neonatal (P0–P1) mice.
Interestingly, two of the fragments drove strong reporter gene expression in lungs (Fig. 1b).
Irx3 is highly expressed during lung development (Fig. 1b) 12, 13, whereas Fto expression in
lungs is limited (Extended Data Fig. 3a and references 2, 14–16). Consistent with our data, a
previous report has shown that the FTO obesity-associated region contains enhancers that
drive Irx3-like expression in zebrafish 17.

Our data suggest that the regulatory landscape of IRX3 spreads over megabase distances,
whereas FTO expression is primarily regulated by regions proximal to its promoter. To test
this, we engineered a human Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) spanning 162 Kb of
the FTO locus, including its promoter and the 47-Kb obesity-associated region (Extended
Data Fig. 3). We recombineered a reporter cassette at the FTO translation start and
generated transgenic mice harboring the engineered BAC. Transgenic mice expressed the
reporter gene in multiple tissues, recapitulating the endogenous expression pattern of FTO14.
We next determined that a 1.2 Kb region corresponding to the FTO promoter is sufficient to
recapitulate most of the FTO expression pattern (Extended Data Fig. 3). In contrast, a 2.8-kb
region corresponding to the IRX3 promoter does not recapitulate any of the endogenous
expression patterns of IRX3, suggesting that IRX3 expression relies on long-range cisregulatory elements. A total of 15 human sequences in the broader FTO-IRX locus have
been characterized as in vivo enhancers in mouse 17, 18, driving reporter expression in Irx3expressing tissues, including eye, limb, brain, neural tube, and branchial arches 12, 19
(Supplementary Table 2). While these enhancers lie outside the obesity association interval,
they are consistent with our chromatin looping data pointing to a broad Irx3 regulatory
landscape, extending into Fto. Further supporting these findings, the genomic interval
spanning FTO and IRX3 has been proposed to be part of a single genomic regulatory block,
based on the presence of extended synteny across deep phylogenies and a high density of

highly conserved noncoding elements 17, as well as patterns of CTCF binding and chromatin
interactions 20. Under these models, our data support the notion that the broad expression
patterns of FTO are primarily regulated by elements proximal to the promoter, and that IRX3
is endowed with an ancient, extensive cis-regulatory circuitry extending into FTO.

We next determined that gene expression studies in human brains corroborate our chromatin
looping data, showing that the obesity-associated SNPs are associated with expression levels
of IRX3, but not FTO. Our data and that of others 17 (Fig. 1b) demonstrate that the obesityassociated SNPs overlap several in vivo enhancers, raising the possibility that allelic variants
may disrupt enhancer activity and alter expression of their target gene(s). To test this, we
carried out eQTL mapping in human brain samples. FTO and IRX3 are highly expressed in
multiple regions of the brain including cerebellum and hypothalamus (Extended Data Fig.
4). Utilizing a dataset of 153 brain samples from individuals of European ancestry 21,
represented by cerebellum, we found significant association between 11 SNPs previously
associated with increased body mass index (BMI), and expression of IRX3, but not FTO
(Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 3). These common SNPs have minor allele frequencies
ranging from 42.5 to 47.5% and are in strong LD with each other (Extended Data Fig. 5). In
all cases, such as for SNP rs9930506 (Fig. 2b), the allele associated with increased BMI is
also associated with increased IRX3 expression. Further analysis, utilizing the GIANT
Consortium dataset of SNPs associated with BMI in 249,796 individuals 22, reveals that
among SNPs significantly associated with IRX3 expression in brain or adipose tissue, only
those associated with IRX3 in brain show highly significant associations with BMI (Fig. 2c).
Taken together, our data directly ties the noncoding genetic variation within FTO to tissuespecific modulation of IRX3, but not FTO, expression in human brain.

Next, we exploited animal models to determine a potential role for IRX3 expression in the
regulation of BMI and/or metabolism. Mice homozygous for an Irx3 null allele (Irx3KO) are
viable and fertile, with no evidence of embryonic lethality. We observed a 25–30%
reduction of body weight in Irx3KO mice compared to control littermates (wild-type; WT),
independent of gender (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6a, b and 7a, b). This difference
becomes more pronounced if animals were subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD), with Irx3KO
animals showing no significant body weight gain, contrasting to a 63% increase in control
animals (Fig. 3a, b). Importantly, the percentage of fat mass in Irx3KO mice was
significantly reduced without marked change of the lean mass ratio (Fig. 3c, d, and Extended
Data Fig. 7c, d). Irx3KO mice exhibit marked reduction in adiposity with smaller fat depots
as well as reduced adipocyte size (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 6b–d, 7e, f). These results
were confirmed by differential gene expression of adiposity markers (i.e. leptin, adiponectin,
and mcp1) in the Irx3KO perigonadal white adipose tissue (PWAT) (Extended Data Fig. 6e).
Importantly, Fto expression was not altered in Irx3KO hypothalamus or PWAT, suggesting
that the lean phenotype of Irx3KO mice is not associated with Fto (Fig. 3f). Since Irx3KO
mice were resistant to HFD-induced obesity and metabolic disorder, such as hepatosteatosis
(Fig. 3e), we examined glucose homeostasis by performing glucose tolerance tests (GTT)
and insulin tolerance test (ITT) at different time points in the presence or absence of HFD.
In 8-week old mice, no difference in GTT was found (Fig. 3g). While aging and HFD led to

glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in WT mice, Irx3KO mice showed none of these
metabolic phenotypes (Fig. 3g–j).

Author Manuscript

Indirect calorimetric analysis showed higher energy expenditure in Irx3KO mice (Fig. 3k
and Extended Data Fig. 8a, b & e). Importantly, Irx3KO mice show up-regulation of brown
adipocyte markers in PWAT, including Ucp1, Ppargc1a, Prdm16, and Cidea, as well as
increased expression of Adrb3 encoding the β3-adrenergic receptor, suggestive of elevated
sympathetic activation (Fig. 3l). Furthermore, we found a significant increase of Ucp1
expression in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of Irx3KO mice (Extended Data Fig. 8e, f).
WAT predominantly stores excessive calories and its accumulation causes obesity, while
brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy (lipids and glucose) and has been the focus
for potential development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat obesity and diabetes. Our
data suggest that “browning” of WAT by higher sympathetic tone and activation of BAT
might lead to increased energy expenditure in Irx3KO mice and partially account for their
leanness and protection from diet-induced obesity.

Author Manuscript

Browning of WAT by increased sympathetic activity is a phenomenon controlled by
hypothalamic circuits integrating central and peripheral metabolism regulation. Our human
eQTL data suggest that the obesity-associated SNPs are associated with IRX3 expression in
brain. We determined that Irx3 is expressed in the arcuate nucleus and median eminence of
the hypothalamus, two critical regions involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis
(Fig. 3m)23,24. To investigate a possible role of Irx3 expression in the hypothalamus
mediating the body composition and energy homeostasis phenotypes in Irx3KO mice, we
utilized Rosa26EnR-Irx3 conditional transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative form of
Irx3 (EnR-Irx3) by crossing with Ins2-Cre (Extended Data Fig. 9a, b)23,25. This design
allows for disrupting Irx3 function while preserving the architecture of genomic interactions
between the Irx3 promoter and long-range regulatory sequences including the Fto obesityassociated region. Remarkably, EnR-Irx3;Ins2-Cre mice phenocopy the physiological,
histological, and molecular metabolism phenotypes of germline Irx3KO mice (Fig. 4a–d and
Extended Data Fig. 9c, d). Energy expenditure was significantly higher in EnR-Irx3;Ins2Cre mice with similar food intake and locomotor activity (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig.
10a–e). Notably, these mice also exhibited “browning” of WAT as well as activation of
BAT (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 10f–g). Together, our data support the notion that the
hypothalamic expression of Irx3 regulates energy homeostasis and body composition.

Author Manuscript

Our results do not dispute the notion emerging from animal models that Fto is also a
regulator of body mass and composition. The functional link between FTO and body mass
regulation originated from animal models, unequivocally demonstrating that variation in
FTO expression results in variation in body mass phenotypes. But to assess the null
expectation that genetic manipulations in mice may result in variation in these parameters,
we searched among 7,556 targeted mouse gene knock-out models for evidence of alterations
in body size, mass, and growth (See Methods). Nearly one third (2,166; 29%) of gene
knock-outs in mice show alteration of these phenotypes, underscoring that animal models
alone are not sufficient to definitively establish a functional relationship between a given
gene and long-range noncoding variants (Supplementary Table 4). It is the aggregate of our
data on chromatin looping, patterns of in vivo enhancer function, human eQTL mapping and

mouse model data that collectively place IRX3 as an important target gene of the genetic
association with human obesity. These observations have direct implication on how to
interpret the associations characterized for thousands of noncoding variants with human
disease and related quantitative traits. We observe more than 150 genomic regulatory
blocks, similar to that containing FTO and IRX3, overlapping with noncoding SNPs
associated with human disease and complex traits in GWAS (Methods and Supplementary
Table 5), highlighting the need for a careful experimental pipeline to define the target
gene(s) for each disease-associated noncoding SNP.

Author Manuscript

Our data posit that the obesity-associated SNPs within FTO are functionally connected with
regulation of IRX3 expression, and that IRX3 is an important determinant of body mass and
composition. IRX3 encodes a transcription factor highly expressed in brain. While our data
represent the first demonstration of the intersection of IRX3 biology with body mass
composition and metabolism, previous work identified IRX3 overexpression in adipocytes as
a hallmark of the molecular switch seen in patients after profound weight loss following
bariatric surgery26. These data indicate that IRX3 may have important roles regulating
metabolism beyond the ones we describe associated with Irx3 expression in hypothalamus.
Future investigations will determine the precise molecular mechanisms by which IRX3
regulates metabolic parameters.

3C assays were performed as referred in27. Mouse brain tissue was processed to get single
cells samples. 10 millions isolated cells were treated with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH
8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.3% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich, I8896), 1X protease inhibitor
cocktail (cOmplete, Roche, 11697498001)) and nuclei were digested with HindIII
endonuclease (Roche, 10798983001). Subsequently, DNA was ligated with T4 DNA ligase
(Promega, M1804). A set of locus specific primers (see table) was designed with the online
program primer3 v. 0.4.028, each one close to a HindIII restriction site. These primers were
used to make real time quantitative PCRs using a BioRad CFX96 Real Time System with
SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (BioRad 172-5203), in order to measure the relative
enrichment in each ligation product. The primer designed within the LD-block was used as
fixed primer. The quality of all primer pairs was measured using serial dilutions of a BAC
DNA that encompass the regions of interest (RP23-268O10, RP23-96F3). PCR values were
normalized by means of control primers designed in the Ercc3 gene locus. The average of
four independent experiments was graphically represented.

DNA ligase (Promega, M1804). Subsequently, Csp6I endonuclease (Fermentas, Thermo
Scientific, FD0214) was used in a second round of digestion, and the DNA was ligated
again. Specific primers were designed near each gene promoter with primer3. Viewpoint
fragend coordinates were as follows: mFTO: chr8:93837310–93837724; mIrx3:
chr8:94325277–94326009. Illumina adaptors were included in the primers sequence32. 16
PCRs were performed with Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche, 11759060001) for
each viewpoint, pooled together and purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit
(Roche, 11732668001). Quanti-iT™ PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, P11496) was
used in order to measure sample concentration, and then they were sent for deep sequencing.
4C-seq data were analysed, with some changes, as described in 30.

Author Manuscript

Briefly, raw sequencing data were de-multiplexed and aligned using either the Mouse July
2007 (NCBI37/mm9) or Zebrafish December 2008 (Zv8/danRer6) assembly as the reference
genome. Reads located in fragments flanked by two restriction sites of the same enzyme, or
in fragments smaller than 40 bp were filtered out. Mapped reads were then converted to
reads-per-1kb-bin units, and smoothed using a running mean 5-fragment window algorithm.
To calculate the statistically significant targets for each viewpoint, a background theoretical
model was calculated as the exponential fit curve of the average signal of 61 4C-Seq
different samples33–35. The p-value for each bin was calculated by means of Poisson
probability function. Smoothed data were uploaded to the UCSC Browser36 for visualization
and plotted using the browser and Circos37. For plotting, statistically significant targets were
defined as p<0.01. Data was submitted to GEO under accession GSE52830, and can be

ChIA-PET to capture long-range chromatin interactions associated with RNA polymerase II.
Locus conservation
To assess the level of high-level conservation of the FTO/IRX5 locus, we used phastCons41
elements and scores as a measurement of conservation.

Author Manuscript

High-scoring phastCons elements (LOD > 680, top 1%) cover 3% (38,040/1,244,409 bp) of
the genomic space that includes FTO and IRX5 (hg19, chr16:53731249–54975288), whereas
on average, only 0.5% +− 0.6 of genomic intervals with the same length are occupied by
such high-scoring phastCons elements. Genomic intervals of the same size of the FTO/IRX3
locus were generated every 10kb for each chromosome. The FTO/IRX5 is at the top 1%
intervals containing high-scoring phastCons elements.
Similarly, in the FTO/IRX5 interval, 9% of the base pairs have phastCons score above 0.9
(range: 0.0–1.0), whereas 14,164 intervals from all chromosomes of the same size offset by
200kb contain only 3.8% +− 1.9 of such high-scoring base pairs. At 9%, the FTO/IRX5 is at
the top 2% intervals with the most conserved base pairs.
These results indicate that the FTO/IRX5 interval contains significantly more highly
conserved base pairs than most genomic loci.

Enhancer reporter constructs, including the modified BAC, were created as previously
reported42. The human (NCBI37/hg19) genomic coordinates of the elements cloned are:

homologous recombination was facilitated by using the following homology arms: FTOhArm1: chr16:53738047–53738096; FTO-hArm2: chr16:53738133–53738182.

analysis and tested each marker in the locus for the additive effect of allele dosage on the
residual expression phenotype (IRX3 and FTO) after adjusting for the PCs (n=2). Similarly,
for cerebellum, we performed linear regression on the residual expression phenotype (IRX3
and FTO) after adjusting for sex and pH to evaluate the additive effect of allele dosage at
each marker in the locus; the non-diseased samples (obtained from the Stanley Medical
Research Institute) included in the analysis were of European descent and thus the PCs were
not used to generate the residual expression. Significance (p-value) was evaluated using the

29). We extracted the p-values for those SNPs in the locus with significant association
(p<0.05) with IRX3 or FTO expression in adipose or cerebellum. We plotted the distribution
of association p-values for these expression-associated SNPs (eSNPs). rs9930506 is highly
associated with BMI (p=1.41e-53, N=123541). Recombination rates are estimated from the
International HapMap Project.

Mice

Author Manuscript

All animal experimental protocols approved by Animal Care Committee of the Toronto
Centre of Phenogenomics conformed to the standards of the Canadian Council on Animal
Care. Irx3-deficient (Irx3KO) mice 47 and Ins2-Cre mice 48 were described previously.
Rosa26EnR-Irx3 conditional transgenic mice (EnR-Irx3) was generated using pROSA26PA
gene-targeting vector as previously described 49. Mice were maintained on 12-hour light/
dark cycles and provided with food and water ad libitum. For diet-induced obesity studies, 8
week old male mice were subjected to 45% high-fat diet (Research Diets) for 10 weeks.
Body weight was measured every week from 4 to 18 weeks of age, and body composition
was analyzed using a EchoMRI device (Echo Medical Systems) at 18 weeks of age. Body
mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing body weight (g) by body length (mm) squared
(BMI = body weight/body length2).

Metabolic phenotyping experiments
Energy expenditure was evaluated via indirect calorimetry (Oxymax System, Columbus
Instruments) over periods of 24 hour. Briefly, energy expenditure was calculated by
multiplying oxygen consumption (VO2) by the calorific value (CV = 3.815 + 1.232 ×
respiratory exchange ratio) and corrected by lean mass. Locomotor activity and food intake
were also measured simultaneously. For glucose and insulin tolerance tests, mice were
subjected to intraperitoneal bolus injection of glucose (1mg/g of body weight) or insulin
(1.5mU/g) after fasting for overnight (14–16 hours) or 6 hours with water ad libitum,

respectively. Blood glucose levels were measured at the indicated intervals. For histological
analysis, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. 5 μm
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Irx3 expression in brain and lung
was examined using Irx3lacZ knockin mice with beta-galactosidase staining.
Gene and protein expression analyses
Total RNA was extracted from fat tissues or hypothalamus using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit
(Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA using M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT). Gene expression assay was conducted using
SYBR Green methods on Viia7 (Applied Biosystems), and relative Ct values were
normalized by β-actin. Primer sequences are available upon request.

Author Manuscript

Western blot analysis was performed as previously described 50. The same amount of
protein extracted from hypothalamus or brown adipose tissues was loaded, which was
confirmed by β-actin as a loading control. Antibodies used are as follows: Ucp1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), Irx3 (generated in-house), and β-actin (Calbiochem).
Statistics

Author Manuscript

All results are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. Statistical significance of differences among
groups was determined by Student’s t-test or ANOVA with post hoc analysis, StudentNewman-Keuls using Sigma Stat (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Differences at P < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant (*, P < 0.05 vs. WT or control; #, P < 0.05 vs. WT,
HFD). Following numbers of mice/samples were used for comparison; Body weight
measurement for Irx3 mice (ND, WT/KO: n = 32/25; HFD, WT/KO: n = 12/7) and EnRIrx3 mice (control/mutant: n = 9/12); Body composition analysis for Irx3 mice (ND
WT/KO: n = 21/12; HFD WT/KO: n = 8/5) and EnR-Irx3 mice (control/mutant: n = 9/12);
Glucose tolerance test for Irx3 mice (ND 8wk, WT/KO: n = 8/5; ND 18wk, WT/KO: n =
10/6; HFD 18wk, WT/KO: n = 12/7) and EnR-Irx3 mice (control/mutant: n = 5/8); Insulin

mice(ND WT/KO: n = 7/5; HFD WT/KO: n = 8/4) and EnR-Irx3 mice(control/mutant: n =
5/7), and Gene expression analysis for Irx3 mice (WT/KO: n = 10/7) and EnR-Irx3 mice
(control/mutant: n = 5/7).
Mouse Body Mass Phenotypes
To calculate the fraction of knockout mice that display a phenotype affecting body mass, we
consulted the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database51.

Author Manuscript

First, to determine the number of gene knockouts that result in a body mass phenotype, we
needed to define a more precise phenotype. The Mammalian Phenotype Ontology52 (http://
www.informatics.jax.org/searches/MP_form.shtml) specifies a controlled vocabulary by
which all mice in the MGI database are classified. Within this framework, (we believed) the
most applicable is “abnormal postnatal growth/weight/body size” (MP:0002089).
Next, we crafted a query using the MouseMine portal53 (http://www.mousemine.org) to
access the MGI database, using MP:0002089 as the search criteria in the “Mammalian

phenotypes --> Mouse genotypes” template (http://www.mousemine.org/mousemine/
template.do?name=MPhenotype_MFeature&scope=all). We asked for all targeted alleles on
chromosomes 1–19, X and Y, reasoning that many non-targeted (i.e. random, chemical and
radiation-induced) mutations have not been precisely mapped, making it difficult if not
impossible to ensure that they are not counted multiple times. Also, in the context of our
study, we are discussing the chance that a targeted knockout would give a specific
phenotype, so these types of alleles are most relevant. Finally, we excluded alleles present
only as cell lines, resulting in 2166 unique genes.
To determine the total number of targeted mutations present in the MGI database, we
performed a search identical to that above but omitting the MP:0002089 term, resulting in
7556 unique genes.

Genomic Regulatory Blocks
Genomic regulatory blocks are regions under strong selection that contain a number of
syntenic highly conserved sequences, believed to regulate a syntenic target gene (“anchor
gene”, the gene that is the raison d’être of the GRB). There are different approaches to
determine GRBs, usually identifying syntenic genes and non-coding conserved regions that
span a region and determining the boundaries of the region.
GWAS identified SNPs that might affect non-coding regulatory elements that, by their turn,
regulate specific target genes. Assignment of regulatory elements to targets is still a
challenge, the simplest method being to assign them to the nearest gene. In the case of FTO,
because the GWAS SNP occurs in an FTO intron, this gene was considered to be the target.

Author Manuscript

The notion put forward here is that when regulatory elements occur within a GRB, which is
the case for FTO/IRX3/IRX5, it is likely that they target the anchor gene (IRX3/IRX5),
given its importance. Supplemental Table 5 contains an annotation of GRBs and their
anchor genes and the GWAS SNPs within the GRB as well as annotation regarding whether
the nearest gene is the anchor gene or not. In those cases in which the nearest gene differs
from the anchor gene, we propose that the anchor gene be used as the putative target and
additional experimentation as shown in this work should be performed to precisely
determine which is the target gene for the GWAS-affected regulatory element.
Genomic regulatory blocks were obtained from UCNEbase (http://ccg.vital-it.ch/
UCNEbase/)54. Human UCNE clusters (hg19) were downloaded from http://ccg.vital-it.ch/
UCNEbase/data/download/clusters/hg19_clusters_coord.bed and are referred here as GRBs.

Author Manuscript

The hg19 GWAS catalog from the UCSC Genome browser was downloaded and the tagging
SNPs contained in GRBs with more than 1 gene (making SNP assigning doubtful) were kept
for further annotation. SNPs occurring in exons were removed. The nearest gene was
considered to be the RefSeq gene whose transcription start site was the nearest, or the gene
where the SNP is contained.

EpiGenome Browser (http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser/). b, Hi-C data
previously generated{Jin, 2013 #49} in human IMR-90 (fetal lung) cells. In the association
interval, the IRX3 signal is stronger than the background (random) signal. However, the
signal for FTO is not. c, 3C data generated with adult (8 wks) mouse brain. Using bait (red
circle) in the association interval (red rectangle), we observe more frequent interactions with
the Irx3 promoter compared to control regions 1 and 2 that are 29 and 42 kb away,
respectively, indicative of looping.

enhancers present. The broad expression is consistent with previous reports in human and
mouse (see main text for references). At bottom, the promoter-lacZ construct is isolated:
only the 1,237 bp proximal to the transcriptional start site are included. Broad expression is
recapitulated, indicating the robust transcriptional competency of the human FTO promoter.
c, In contrast, the 2,820 bp proximal human IRX3 promoter is not sufficient to drive lacZ
expression, which is consistent with an enhancer-dependent transcriptional control
mechanism.

Figure 1. Long-range interactions in the IRX3/FTO locus

a, Mouse embryo 4C-seq interactions emanating from each promoter are displayed as links
across the circle (darker link implies greater significance). Outer plots show significance of
interactions above background (-log(p-value)). The obesity-associated interval is highlighted
red. b, Magnified view of the association interval. Contained within are the orthologous
locations of obesity-associated SNPs (black pips), and epigenetic marks associated with
regulatory elements. Endogenous Irx3 expression is shown (1. lung, 2. brain) in Irx3lacZ

Figure 2. BMI-associated SNPs are eSNPs for IRX3, not FTO, expression in human brain

Author Manuscript

a, SNPs associated with BMI in the FTO locus. 43 SNPs associated with IRX3 expression
(eSNPs) are shown in red, including 11 also associated with BMI. No SNPs are associated
with FTO expression (p-value>0.05). Arrowheads: IRX3 eSNPs outside the obesityassociated region (pink); arrow: rs9930506. b, In cerebellum, the allele of rs9930506
associated with increased BMI (risk allele) is correlated with increased IRX3 expression and
not with FTO expression. c, Histogram plotting the number of SNPs associated with IRX3
expression in adipose (black) and brain (red) (y-axis) by the significance of their association
with BMI (x-axis). Full statistical details in Methods.
