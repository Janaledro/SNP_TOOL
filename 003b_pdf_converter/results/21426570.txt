Abstract
Background: Adipose tissue abundance relies partly on the factors that regulate adipogenesis, i.e. proliferation and
differentiation of adipocytes. While components of the transcriptional program that initiates adipogenesis is wellknown, the importance of microRNAs in adipogenesis is less well studied. We thus set out to investigate whether
miRNAs would be actively modulated during adipogenesis and obesity.
Methods: Several models exist to study adipogenesis in vitro, of which the cell line 3T3-L1 is the most well known,
albeit not the most physiologically appropriate. Thus, as an alternative, we produced EXIQON microarray of brown
and white primary murine adipocytes (prior to and following differentiation) to yield global profiles of miRNAs.
Results: We found 65 miRNAs regulated during in vitro adipogenesis in primary adipocytes. We evaluated the
similarity of our responses to those found in non-primary cell models, through literature data-mining. When
comparing primary adipocyte profiles, with those of cell lines reported in the literature, we found a high degree of
difference in ‘adipogenesis’ regulated miRNAs suggesting that the model systems may not be accurately
representing adipogenesis. The expression of 10 adipogenesis-regulated miRNAs were studied using real-time qPCR
and then we selected 5 miRNAs, that showed robust expression, were profiled in subcutaneous adipose tissue
obtained from 20 humans with a range of body mass indices (BMI, range = 21-48, and all samples have U133+2
Affymetrix profiles provided). Of the miRNAs tested, mir-21 was robustly expressed in human adipose tissue and
positively correlated with BMI (R2 = 0.49, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: In conclusion, we provide a preliminary analysis of miRNAs associated with primary cell in vitro
adipogenesis and demonstrate that the inflammation-associated miRNA, mir-21 is up-regulated in subcutaneous
adipose tissue in human obesity. Further, we provide a novel transcriptomics database of EXIQON and Affymetrix
adipocyte profiles to facilitate data mining.

Background
Obesity is a major global health problem linked to serious medical conditions including diabetes, heart disease,
arthritis and cancer [1]. Adipose tissue is not only a main
site of energy storage but also an important endocrine
organ. It is a crucial regulator of energy balance and glucose homeostasis in mammals (reviewed in [2]). Imbalances in energy homeostasis cause obesity. Most of the
lipid reserves in the human body are stored in white

adipose tissue (WAT) that predominates in adult
humans. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), despite its ability
to accumulate lipids, has a role not in storing but in converting fat into heat. Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP-1) in
the inner membrane of brown-fat mitochondria uncouples electron transport from ATP production, allowing
energy dissipation, thus helping to regulate body temperature [3]. Recent evidence indicates that brown fat is
important not only in newborns as previously thought
but also in adult humans [4]. It has been suggested
recently that human obesity is associated with altered
function of brown adipose tissue [5,6] or appearance of

brown adipocytes within WAT [7]. Understanding the
regulation of the pathways that lead to proliferation and
differentiation of white and brown pre-adipocytes could
be crucial for revealing the underlying mechanisms of
obesity. While primary white and brown pre-adipocytes
look identical, these two cell types originate from separate
precursor cells [8] in the early embryo [9,10]. Brown fat
cells arise from a pre-muscle cell lineage [8]. In addition
to the classic brown adipocytes, a different type of brown
fat cells seems to exist in tissues where WAT predominates. These cells are more closely related to white adipocytes but have the potential to induce UCP1 expression
[11]. It has been suggested that adipogenesis is regulated
by PPARb/δ followed by PPARg and C/EBPa promoting
differentiation into mature adipocytes [12]. Maturation of
BAT and WAT follow a similar adipogenic transcriptional program, albeit several genes show cell type-dependent expression. For instance, Prdm16 is expressed in
BAT and when ectopically expressed in white preadipocytes, can promote brown fat differentiation [13].
A growing body of evidence implicates a role for
microRNAs (miRNAs) in adipogenesis and obesity
[14,15]. Indeed, the lineage difference between white and
brown adipocytes has not only been shown on the basis
of different mRNA expression but also at the levels of
microRNA expression, as shown by Walden et al. [16].
Further, miRNAs can both target [17] and be induced by
transcription factors [18]. MiRNAs are short non-coding
RNA molecules that allow for fine-tuning of protein
expression in vivo [19]. They act at a post-transcriptional
level by binding to the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of an
mRNA largely leading to translational regulation in vivo
in mammals [19,20]. There are several examples of miRNAs that regulate metabolic processes associated with
metabolic disease. Mir-122 can regulate lipid/glucose
homeostasis in the liver [21]. Mir-375 [22] and miR-9
[23] can influence insulin secretion, while mir-34a can
increase hormone secretion in insulin-secreting cells
when exposed to palmitate [24]. The first miRNA found
to play a role in maturation of human adipocytes was
miR-143 [25,26]. miR-143 and also miR-103 can induce
adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and augment or accelerate expression of several key adipogenesis-regulated
genes, such as FABP4 and adiponectin [27]. Activation of
the miRNA cluster miR-17~92 enhances adipogenesis
[28] while let-7 and miR-27 impair adipogenic differentiation [29,30]. Several miRNAs are upregulated in adipose tissue in animal models of metabolic disease and/or
obesity, e.g. mir-125a [31], mir29 [32], and mir-143 [33],
while adipose tissue miR-519d expression is associated
with human obesity [15]. Recently, Ortega et al. claimed
that the expression of 70 miRNAs is modulated during
differentiation of human adipocytes, with 15 of them

showing dysregulation in obese individuals compared
with non-obese persons [14].
Expression profiling of miRNAs in various adipocyte
culture systems has yielded inconsistent results so far
[25-27]. Studies have mostly been performed using cell
lines and thus there is a lack of knowledge of the
miRNA expression profile in primary adipocyte cells.
Furthermore, there is no parallel analysis of both white
and brown differentiating primary adipocytes. Thus, we
performed a global expression profiling of miRNAs in
white and brown murine primary cell cultures before
and after differentiation. We found that 51 unique miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 14 significantly
downregulated after the differentiation into adipocytes.
We also demonstrated that differences in miRNA regulation between white and brown adipocytes during
maturation are surprisingly modest. We investigated the
expression of selected maturation-associated miRNAs in
subcutaneous adipose tissue from humans with varying
body mass indices and found that mir-21 expression
correlated positively with human obesity. The present
manuscript presents these miRNA gene-chip data sets,
along with a pilot Affymetrix data set of n = 33 human
adipose global U133+2 tissue profiles, as a novel obesity
and adipogenesis database for others to utilise.

Methods
Murine samples

The experiments were approved by the ethical committee
of North Stockholm. Male outbred NMRI mice, 4 weeks
old, were used for the preparation of primary cultures of
brown and white preadipocytes, as described previously
[11,34]. Mouse white adipose tissue (WAT) was harvested
from the epididymal fat pad, while mouse brown adipose
tissue (BAT) was harvested from the interscapular region.
Preadipocytes were differentiated for 3 days (preadipocyte
population) and 7 days (mature adipocyte population)
in vitro. The culture medium was Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum (Invitrogen), 2.4 nm insulin, 25 μg/ml sodium ascorbate,
10 mm HEPES, 4 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin,
and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown at
37°C in an atmosphere of 8% CO 2 in air with 80%
humidity. The medium was changed on day 1 and then
every second day. RNA was extracted from preadipocytes
and adipocytes using Trizol (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Human samples and physiological measurements

Twenty healthy subjects of Scandinavian origin with
normal glucose tolerance but different degrees of obesity
participated in the study conducted by CIM, Copenhagen. The study included individuals from a previous

Keller et al. BMC Endocrine Disorders 2011, 11:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6823/11/7

analysis [35] and individual data can be found along
with global transcript profiles at GSE27951. Their mean
(SD) age, BMI and VO 2max were 46 (13) years, 32 (7)
kg/m2 and 31 (13) VO 2max/kg, with the range in BMI
being 21-48 kg/m 2 . Adipose tissue biopsies were
obtained from the subcutaneous abdominal region (from
the area below the umbilicus in a 4-cm range on either
side) using the percutaneous needle biopsy technique
with suction. Biopsies were quickly dissected free from
visible blood and connective tissue and frozen in liquid
nitrogen. To avoid interference of circadian rhythms
and post-prandial responses, biopsies were obtained
between 8 am and 10 am following an overnight fast.
A general health examination and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed as previously
described [35]. All tissue processing and RNA work was
done independently of CIM, Copenhagen and CIM had
no input on data analysis.
RNA extraction and quality

Frozen tissue was homogenised in Trizol™ (Invitrogen)
using a motor-driven homogenizer (Polytron, Kinematica,
Newark, NY, USA). RNA was extracted according to manufacturer’s protocol, as previously described [35]. The
quality of the total RNA was examined on an Agilent
Bioanalyzer. Human adipose tissue RNA for miRNA
Taqman qPCR assays was of good quality with spectrophotometer readings of A260/280 >1.7 and RIN scores
>7.5. Murine RNA had A260/280 >1.9 and RIN scores >8.
Exiqon miRCURY™ miRNA arrays

Global microRNA expression analysis was performed
using Exiqon (Vedbæk, Denmark) pre-spotted miRCURY™ V8.1 LNA microRNA microarrays. Preadipocyte and mature adipocyte samples (n = 3+3, for brown
adipocytes and n = 3+3 for white adipocytes) were run
individually on the arrays, i.e. cell cultures were not
pooled. The arrays consist of 1458 capture probes (or as
annotated on the GEO files) that are enhanced using
locked nucleic acid (LNA) technology to normalize the
Tm of the capture probes, as insertion of 1 LNA molecule into the capture probes increases the Tm by 2-8°C.
Total RNA was labelled with Hy 3 -dye using Exiqon’s
miRCURY LNA array labelling kit (Vedbæk, Denmark)
with the inclusion of the miRCURY LNA array synthetic
spike-in miRNAs in the labelling reaction. Two μg of
total RNA was incubated with the Hy 3 dye, labelling
enzyme and spike-in microRNAs for 1 hour at 0°C. The
enzyme was then heat-inactivated at 65°C for 15 minutes, followed by addition of 2 x hybridisation buffer.
The samples were incubated at 95°C for 5 minutes, protected from light. The samples were then briefly spun
down and filtered through a 0.45-micron durapore filter
(Millipore), and 40 μl sample was loaded to the arrays

Page 3 of 11

by capillary force using a cover slip (Erie Scientific). The
arrays were incubated at 60°C for 16 hours, then washed
briefly in 60°C wash buffer A, rinsed in wash buffer B
followed by a 2-minute wash in wash buffer B and a
2-minute wash in wash buffer C, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For drying the arrays, they were
spun for 2 minutes at 1000 rpm followed by immediate
scanning using an Agilent G2565BA microarray scanner.
Data were analyzed by QuantArray® software using the
fixed-circle approach. Background subtracted signal
intensities were normalized in R using quantile normalization. Data were then analysed using SAM analysis as
previously described [19]. In this case on relevant murine probes and signals above background were utilised
in the SAM analysis. The analysis to determine adipogenesis related miRNAs was performed using brown-cell
and white-cell gene chips combined, to increase the
sample size and hence statistical power. A selected subset of miRNAs modulated more than 1.5-fold was
selected for further analysis by real-time qPCR.
qPCR for the detection of microRNA expression levels in
adipocytes

The expression of 10 miRNAs that showed differential
expression on the microarrays were measured in 12 RNA
samples (3 preadipocyte and 3 adipocyte samples from
both brown and white fat) using the Taqman® MicroRNA
assays (Applied Bioystems) that detect mature miRNA.
10 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the
microRNA-specific looped primer and the TaqMan ®
MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, PN 4366597), according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows:
16°C for 30 min, 42°C for 30 min, and 85°C for 5 min. For
qPCR, the TaqMan® 2X Universal PCR Master Mix, No
AmpErase ® UNG was used (Applied Biosystems, PN
4324020). Experiments were performed in triplicates on a
7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), 9600 emulation mode. The Real-Time cycling
conditions were: 95°C for 10 minutes followed by 50 cycles
of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. The expression of
the reference RNAs used for normalisation, snoRNA142
(murine samples) and RNU48 (human samples), did not
show variation between samples or subjects. All reactions
were run single-plex and analysed and quantified using
the ΔΔCt method. Data are expressed as a fold change
from the value in non-obese persons for the human samples or as a fold change from preadipocyte-levels for the
murine samples. miRNA data obtained by qPCR were analysed using a t-test to compare differences between ΔCt
values (Ct value of target miRNA minus Ct value of reference RNA) either between obese and non-obese persons,
or between adipocytes and preadipocytes. For all analyses,
P < 0.05 was considered significant.

qPCR for the detection of microRNA expression levels in
human fat

Of the 10 miRNAs that showed expression in the adipocyte cultures, we chose a subset of 5 miRNAs (mir-34c,
mir-143, mir-24, mir-720 and mir-21) to measure in
human adipose tissue RNA samples from obese persons
(BMI >30, n = 10) and non-obese persons (BMI <30,
n = 10). The phenotype of these subjects has been
described elsewhere [7,19] and the subject demographics
can be found, along with global mRNA transcriptome
data at GSE27951. This data represents a large pilot
study of n = 33 human adipose tissue samples. We have
previously reported selected gene changes in this tissue
cohort. The RNA profile of the tissue did not support
the conclusion that metabolic or mitochondrial genes
were down-regulated in human obese adipose tissue and
thus contrasts with Dahlman et al [36]. Dahlman et al
did not release the CEL files so we cannot determine if
this difference is biological or technical in nature. Using
RNA isolated from our adipose tissue samples (10 ng
total RNA) the RNA was reverse-transcribed using
reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol to profile
microRNAs.
Detection of cDNAs was performed using an ABIPRISM® 7900 Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems). Primers (Invitrogen) were designed by Primer
Express software (Applied Biosystems) or by the Universal
Probe Library (Roche Applied Science). A pre-optimized
primer and probe assay for 18S rRNA was used as an
endogenous control (Applied Biosystems). Primers and
probes were pre-mixed with TaqMan Universal Master
Mix or SYBR®GREEN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and applied to 384-well MicroAmp Optical barcode
plates (Applied Biosystems). cDNA aliquots of 4 μl were
added in triplicates. The amplification of genomic DNA
typically amounted to a maximum of <1% of the target
gene when extracting RNA by TRIzol [37]. Thermal
cycling conditions were: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C
and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 65°C. Two-fold
dilutions series were performed for all target genes and
endogenous controls to determine the amplification
efficiency.
Gene Ontology analysis using EASE

A miRNA binds to the 3’ UTR of a target mRNA via the
“seed” region of the mature miRNA (nt 2-7). For mir-21,
we used Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to obtain an
overview of the main classes of biological functions of
genes predicted to be targets for this miRNA. For
miRNA target prediction categorised by Gene Ontology,
we used EASE (version 2.0) and a predicted list of conserved miRNA target genes obtained from Targetscan
(http://www.targetscan.org/, release 5.0). For the EASE

Page 4 of 11

analysis, we enlisted a false discovery rate (FDR) and an
EASE score, which we calculated using 500 permutations/iterations. It should be noted that mir-21 is unlikely to be the only obesity regulated miRNA and as
such this ontology analysis should be considered
hypothesis generating rather than definitive.
Network analysis using PubGene

The connectivity of putative miRNA targets was analysed
using the literature co-citation network PubGene (http://
www.pubgene.org). The following explanation is extracted
from the PubGene Public Service User Guide. PubGene
lists records that co-cite gene identifiers. Co-citation suggests biological relationship between the implicated
genes. The Bio Networks tool presents related genes graphically as networks. A count is made of the MEDLINE
records where both the query gene and a neighbour
appear (or a recognized synonym of either of these).
Neighbours of a gene are thereby ranked according to
this count. The Bio Associations tool prepares lists of
keywords associated with gene or protein terms. Using
this tool, we performed a search for process-association
with an individual gene ID. The Bio Associations tool
returns a list of GO terms for process-associations that
co-occur with the query gene in Medline records. The
list is ranked depending on scores assigned to each of the
co-occurring terms. Scoring was computed by a probabilistic method. Using this method, scores approaching 0
show the strongest association between the query gene
and GO term. In principle, scores can be in the range of
0 to 1. The published formula shows the probability of
the term and the gene occurring together the observed
number of times under the assumption that their cooccurrence is not meaningful but instead simply a random event (i.e. the probability of the null hypothesis).
We utilised this approach as a descriptive tool.

Results
Identification of adipogenesis-regulated miRNAs in primary
white and brown murine adipocytes using miRNA arrays

To examine the role of the post-transcriptional regulators
of adipogenesis in a physiologically relevant model, we
profiled primary white and brown pre-adipocytes before
and after differentiation into mature adipocytes (n = 3+3
for each tissue type) using Exiqon miRNA arrays, v.8.1.
Data sets were highly consistent both after background
subtraction and after quantile normalisation of the background subtracted data. The analysis was performed in
two ways. Since there were no large differences between
miRNA expression in brown and white adipocytes, we
used the data from both cell types combined, to increase
the sample size and hence statistical power (Additional file
1). 51 unique miRNAs were significantly upregulated and
14 miRNAs were downregulated during the differentiation

Keller et al. BMC Endocrine Disorders 2011, 11:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6823/11/7

of both white and brown preadipocytes (FDR <10%). Then
we did the analysis of the significant data from brown and
white cells separately using a standard Student T-test to
look for the differences in miRNA regulation during white
and brown adipocyte maturation. While this clearly has
limitations, six miRNAs showed a trend for a stronger
upregulation during white pre-adipocyte differentiation
compared with brown pre-adipocytes, while another 6
miRNAs showed a trend for a stronger upregulation during brown pre-adipocyte development (see Figure 1). Only
two miRNAs seemed to be downregulated more strongly
during white pre-adipocyte maturation compared to
brown, while only one miRNA showed a trend for a stronger downregulation during brown adipocyte differentiation. Such trends are interesting but require confirmation.
In general, differences in miRNA regulation between
white and brown adipocytes during maturation are not
pronounced. The six miRNAs tending to demonstrate a
stronger upregulation during the white adipocyte differentiation included miR-24-1* and miR-23b, members of
a recently identified miR-23b cluster. Another miRNA
that seemed more strongly upregulated during the white
adipocyte differentiation was miR-21. This upregulation
was not significant in the main analysis (FDR >10%), but
we chose to follow up on this miRNA in later experiments because of its reported role in proliferation [38]
and inflammation [39]. We also decided to follow up on
miR-143, which we found upregulated in both white
and brown adipocytes, as mir-143 is induced upon differentiation of human preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 fibroblasts [25-27].
Six miRNAs showed a trend for a stronger upregulation
during the brown adipocyte differentiation - miRPlus_17856, mmu-miR-381, mmu-miR-501-3p, mmumiR-21*, mmu-miR-296-5p and miRPlus_17832. In

Page 5 of 11

contrast to the stronger upregulation of miR-21 in white
cells, miR-21* (the opposite arm of miR-21) seemed to be
more strongly upregulated in brown cells. Of the 14 downregulated miRNAs, miR-669c and miR-34c, tended to be
downregulated further during the maturation of white adipocytes compared to browns. One miRNA, mmu-let-7e,
seemed more downregulated during the brown adipocyte
maturation. Critically, no miRNA showed expression only
in browns or whites in this gene chip study, nor did we
see an opposite regulation pattern in the two cell types,
suggesting that at this level of sensitivity, we captured adipogenesis-regulated miRNAs, rather than miRNAs
involved in cell lineage determination.
qPCR profiling of miRNAs in primary white and brown
adipocyte cultures

From the list of the miRNAs that were differentially
expressed during adipogenesis of primary white or
brown murine adipocytes, we selected a subset of 10
miRNAs for profiling using Taqman-based qPCR. Of
these 10 miRNAs, only mir-21, mir34c and mir-143
were differentially expressed between mature adipocytes
and preadipocytes (p < 0.05), see Table 1 and Figure 2.
Mir-34c upregulation during brown adipocyte maturation was in contrast to our microarray data and this
result must be treated with caution. When comparing
the EXIQON chip and the TaqMan assay, mir-34c
demonstrated the opposite result suggesting that either
the gene-chip probe or the TaqMan assay is unreliable.
Mir-136 and mir-718 were not detectable in the adipocyte cultures using the Taqman assays-on-demand,
while mir-346, mir-298, mir-330 and mir-501 were
expressed at low levels (Ct levels above 33), see Table 1.
This suggests that currently there is no gold standard
method (when RNA is limiting) to validate miRNA data
profiles. It should however be noted that the development of the EXIQON chip has progressed since Version
8 and some of these issues may now be resolved. Nevertheless, the miRNAs mir-34c, mir-143, mir-24, mir-720
and mir-21 showed robust expression in the adipocyte
cultures, and these 5 miRNAs were thus profiled in subcutaneous adipose tissue from healthy humans with different BMIs to examine their regulation in adipose
tissue expansion.

We previously validated a novel ranking system to calculate the collective impact of both upregulated and
downregulated miRNAs in vivo [19]. We combined the
conserved target site criteria from the Targetscan database with cell-specific mRNA expression data [8] and
generated a list of genes reliably expressed in adipocytes

and that would be potentially regulated by the combined
action of all the changing miRNAs. We combined the
two non-overlapping lists of up-regulated and downregulated putative targets of miRNAs as previously
described [19] and tested for the targeted biological processes using the ontological analysis (Additional file 2)
using the global adipocyte transcriptome as a background. Highly significant enrichment was uniquely
found within the first quartile of ranked genes, including
transcription regulation (p < 1.62 × 10-6) and regulation
of cellular metabolic processes (p < 4.3 × 10 -4 ). The
fourth quartile of conserved wCCS targets did not show
such enrichment and acts as the control list for this validated method [19]. Ontological enrichment of target
genes shows in a statistically significant manner that distinct biological processes are targeted, notably the ones
related to transcription and metabolism even when

using only expressed miRNA predicted gene targets (a
gene list that has an ontological bias per se).
Network analysis of putative miRNA targets

The connectivity of first quartile ranked genes belonging
to the ontology category SP_PIR_Transcription Regulation genes (FDR <2 × 10-6, in total 37 genes) was analysed using the literature co-citation network PubGene
(http://www.pubgene.org). PubGene lists records that
co-cite gene identifiers. Co-citation suggests biological
relationship between the implicated genes. The network
showing the interconnections between analysed genes
and their first order literature neighbours is shown in
Figure 3. In total there are 132 connections, while the
network based on probability of chance co-occurrence
contains 67 connections. The most connected gene
from this analysed group was Sirt1, which linked
directly to 5 other genes from the analysed group
(Sox4, Bcl6, Neurod1 and Smad7). Using PubGene process associations, we annotated all 37 genes to biological
processes by probabilistic scoring. Five out of 37 analysed genes (Ebf1, Ncoa1, Nr5a2, Sirt1 and Smad7) are
involved in fat cell differentiation (p < 1.9 × 10-7) (see
Additional file 1), while all of the 37 genes play a role
in differentiation, development and/or proliferation processes (p < 0.001). PubGene associated are not fully
validated and such association should be taken as
hypothesis generating.

Five miRNAs (mir-21, mir-143, mir-34c, mir-24 and mir720) were profiled in subcutaneous adipose tissue from
healthy humans with varying degrees of obesity. Mir-21
showed higher expression in persons with a BMI >30,
while mir-143 showed lower expression in persons with a
BMI >30 (p < 0.05), see Figure 4. There was a strong
positive correlation of mir-21 expression in human adipose tissue with BMI (p < 0.001, see Figure 5).

Discussion
We performed global expression profiling of miRNAs
before and after the differentiation of primary murine
white and brown preadipocytes into mature adipocytes,
in order to discover post-transcriptional regulators of
adipogenesis. We found 65 miRNAs differentially
expressed following differentiation of preadipocytes into
adipocytes, but only subtle differences in fold-change of
miRNAs between white and brown adipocytes, suggesting that the identified miRNAs most likely play a role in
adipogenesis per se rather than in cell lineage determination. Ontological analysis of the target genes of the miRNAs regulated during in vitro adipogenesis indicated that
processes related to transcription and metabolism are
potentially targeted by the alteration in miRNA expression. One of the identified adipogenesis-regulated miRNAs, mir-21, showed a positive correlation with obesity
in subcutaneous adipose tissue from healthy humans and
this merits further investigation to verify the location of
mir-21 expression in situ, in adipose tissue.
MiRNAs regulated by adipogenesis

Fiftyone miRNAs were significantly upregulated and fourteen downregulated during the differentiation of both

white and brown preadipocytes. The trend for differences
in the degree of miRNA upregulation or downregulation
between the white and brown adipocytes was 2-fold.
MiR-143 and miR-181a were expressed in both white

and mir-720 were measured in subcutaneous adipose tissue of

healthy persons. miRNA expression levels are normalised to RNU48

not brown adipocytes. miR-669c has recently been implicated in ageing [44] and correlates with the decline of
liver regeneration. The only miRNA that was significantly
downregulated in both brown and white adipocytes (yet
more so during the brown adipocyte maturation) was let7e, which belongs to the let-7 family. Let-7 impairs adipogenic differentiation [29], explaining its downregulation
during the adipogenic process. Consistent with in vitro
adipogenesis, which consists of two processes - cell proliferation followed by differentiation - most of the miRNAs
regulated by adipogenesis in our system are involved in
the regulation of these two processes.

and brown adipocytes during both developmental stages
and showed a trend for a 2-fold enrichment in white adipocytes, similarly to what was found by Walden et al.
[16]. However, from this data set, differences in miRNA
regulation between white and brown adipocyte population were very modest. ‘Muscle-enriched’ miRNAs, miR-1
and miR-133a, previously shown by Walden et al. to be
modestly yet expressed in brown versus white adipocytes
(but not upregulated during their differentiation), were
too low in expression to be detected by this microarray
study.
Two of the six miRNAs showed a trend for a stronger
upregulation during white adipocyte differentiation miR-24-1* and miR-23b. They belong to a recently identified miR-23b cluster shown to be a molecular switch
regulating TGFྞ response of liver stem cells during
their differentiation [40], and also to be regulated by
bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in mesenchymal
stem cells differentiating into adipocytes [41]. The BMP2 signalling pathway plays a role in white adipocyte lineage determination, as BMP-2 can induce commitment
of C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells into white adipocytes [42]. Our results, in combination with these previous observations, suggest that this mechanism might
therefore involve miR-24-1 and miR-23b. Another
important member of this miR-23b cluster is miR-27b,
which has also been shown to play important roles in
adipogenesis by impairing differentiation of human adipocytes and targeting PPARg [43].
However, we found that miR-27b was not robustly
expressed in brown or white primary adipocytes. Two
miRNA, miR-669c and miR-34c, demonstrated a trend
for downregulation during the maturation of white but

Evaluation of the similarity to other models through
literature study

Ortega et al. examined global miRNA expression profiles
during human adipogenesis and whether its pattern significantly differed between cells from obese or lean subjects [14]. The differentiation protocol they used differed
significantly from ours. They cultured human preadipocytes and passed them through 3 passages before the differentiation was induced at confluency using a cocktail of
human Insulin, Dexamethasone, Isobutylmethyl-xanthine
(IBMX), and the PPARg agonist Rosiglitazone, in the presence of fetal bovine serum. This cocktail of drugs is
usually necessary to promote successful differentiation in
clonal cell lines. The cells we isolated from fat tissues
were plated and the differentiation was induced spontaneously in media supplemented with only insulin and
newborn bovine serum, and as such it perhaps provides a
more native differentiation context. In Ortega’s findings
most of the miRNAs showed increased or decreased regulation after 7 days of differentiation. They identified the
cluster of miRNAs related to miR-30 (miR-30a, b, c, d
and e) as being increased during human white adipocyte
maturation and these data are in accordance with our
observations [14]. Ortega et al., however, show miR-503
as the most down-regulated miRNA during differentiation of human adipocytes [14], while in our murine data
set miR-503 was upregulated during both primary brown
and white adipocyte differentiation.. The discrepancy
with respect to mir-503 regulation may relate to differential regulation between man and mouse, or differences in
the differentiation protocols applied.
Our results are also mostly in agreement with those of
Esau et al. [25] who identified a similar expression pattern regarding miR-130b, miR-30c, miR-30a*, miR-191,
miR-30d, miR-196, miR-30b, miR-19b, miR-92, miR-138
and miR-100 during differentiation of cultured human
adipocytes. However, our results are not in accordance
with Esau regarding miR-20, miR-93, miR-103 and miR107. Esau et al., similarly to Ortega et al., used a cocktail
of drugs to induce the differentiation of human preadipocytes. Thus, these discrepancies could again reflect

Keller et al. BMC Endocrine Disorders 2011, 11:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6823/11/7

differences between human and mouse adipogenesis or
differences in in vitro culture conditions. Xie et al. [27]
identified miR-143, miR-148a, miR-30c, miR146b as
being upregulated during in vitro differentiation of 3T3L1 cells, which is identical to our findings. However, Xie
et al. additionally found miR-107 and miR-103 to be
upregulated, similarly to Ortega’s findings in human adipocytes, but contrary to our results. As the regulation of
mir-107 and mir-103 exists in man and mouse, differences in the differentiation protocols applied could
explain the discrepancy. One must also consider the time
when such miRNA analysis was run and the possibility of
alterations in the annotation of both miRNA sequence
and chip design.
One example of miRNAs that can be actively involved
in cell proliferation is the miR-17-92 cluster, which comprises seven miRNAs (miR-17-5p, miR-17-3p, miR-18,
miR-19a, miR-20, miR-19b, and miR-92-1). This miR-1792 cluster is frequently amplified in B-cell lymphomas
and lung cancers, and promotes tumour growth in
human and mouse cell models [45,46]. Wang et al. used
3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells to screen miRNA expression
over seven timepoints after hormonal induction [28].
They found all five members of the miR-17-92 cluster to
be markedly upregulated after hormonal stimulation,
peaking at the clonal expansion stage. In our dataset,
similarly, all members of the cluster were upregulated,
suggesting that this cluster might play a role during both
proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes.
Predicted protein targets and network analysis

To better understand the biological consequences of
simultaneous changes in multiple miRNAs we utilised a
weighted score ranking analysis method [19], which
identifies the protein targets most likely to be regulated
by collective changes in miRNA expression. We found
the ontologies, transcription regulation and regulation of
cellular metabolic processes, were strongly represented
in the miRNA target list. We made a provisional assessment of the connectivity of the genes belonging to the
ontology category ‘SP_PIR_Transcription Regulation’
using the literature co-citation network PubGene. Sirt1
was linked directly to 5 other genes from the analysed
group. Sirt1, an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, belongs
to the family of sirtuins, and regulates key aspects of
lipid metabolism. Sirt1 plays a role in 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, as Sirt1 protein levels increase during adipogenesis,
and overexpression of Sirt1 prevents adipogenesis by
inhibiting PPARg transactivation of adipogenesis-related
genes, while knock-down of Sirt1 promotes fat accumulation [47]. Activation of Sirt1 increases the release of
FFA in both mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in primary
white rat adipocytes [47]. Sirt1 also appears to exert an
anti-inflammatory effect and improves insulin sensitivity

Page 9 of 11

in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by promoting insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake [48]. Accordingly, Sirt1 activators
improve insulin resistance in ob/ob and diet-induced
obese mice, and increase insulin sensitivity in obese,
insulin-resistant Zucker rats [49]. Sirt1 genetic variation
in humans is related to BMI and risk of obesity [50].
The miRNAs targeting Sirt1 include miR-143, miR-23b
miR-34c as well as mir-34a [51,52].
Adipogenesis-regulated miRNAs and human obesity

Of the miRNAs we described in the murine primary cell
cultures, miR-21 and miR-143 were differentially
expressed in healthy non-obese persons (BMI <30) versus obese persons (BMI >30). Furthermore, we found a
robust positive correlation of mir-21 with BMI in
healthy humans. In the ob/ob mouse, which develops
obesity and type 2 diabetes-like symptoms, expression of
mir-21 in liver is downregulated [53] suggesting that
mir-21 may have different roles depending on the cell
type. Both miR-21 and miR-143 show an altered expression level in cancer: miR-21 is upregulated 5-fold in
colorectal cancer, when compared with adjacent nontumour tissue, while miR-143 is downregulated 3-fold
[54]. In human hepatocellular cancer [55], and in breast
tumours [56], miR-21 is also overexpressed, when compared with normal tissue. An anti-miR-21 strategy
decreases tumour growth in vivo, possibly by enhancing
apoptosis [56]. Cell proliferation is increased by miR-21
overexpression, while it is decreased by an anti-miR-21
strategy, when modest changes in miR-21 expression are
achieved (2 to 4-fold changes) [55]. In obese subjects
there is an expansion of fat tissue, and while mir-21 is
positively correlated to BMI, it is unknown whether
mir-21 can induce adipose tissue expansion, or if it is
increased as a consequence of adipose tissue expansion
or the inclusion of additional cell types within the tissue.
Gabriely et al. found that downregulation of mir-21 in
glioma cells reduces their invasive potential, probably by
relieving mir-21 targeting of metalloprotease inhibitors,
allowing metallo proteases to be active [57]. These data
thus suggest that mir-21 could be important for tissue
expansion, albeit this will require substantial experimental verification.

Conclusion
We have identified 65 miRNAs regulated during adipogenesis in primary brown and white adipocytes and
show that one miRNA, mir-21, correlates positively with
human obesity. We also compared our list of adipogenesis-regulated miRNAs with different model systems and
find that there are important differences between cell
lines or animal models of obesity, and our primary adipocyte profiles. We provide an mRNA and miRNA
gene-chip resource for further analysis.
