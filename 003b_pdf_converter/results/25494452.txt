Abstract
Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs

in a minority of smokers and is characterized by intermittent
exacerbations and clinical subphenotypes such as emphysema
and chronic bronchitis. Although sphingolipids as a class are
implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD, the particular sphingolipid
species associated with COPD subphenotypes remain unknown.

sphingolipids. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to test
associations between sphingolipid gene expression and plasma
sphingolipids.

Objectives: To use mass spectrometry to determine which plasma
sphingolipids are associated with subphenotypes of COPD.

Measurements and Main Results: Of the measured plasma
sphingolipids, ﬁve sphingomyelins were associated with emphysema;
four trihexosylceramides and three dihexosylceramides were
associated with COPD exacerbations. Three sphingolipids were
strongly associated with sphingolipid gene expression, and
15 sphingolipid gene/metabolite pairs were differentially regulated
between COPD cases and control subjects.

Methods: One hundred twenty-nine current and former smokers

Conclusions: There is evidence of systemic dysregulation of

known about what predisposes certain
smokers to develop a particular COPD
phenotype. Recently, there have been

reports suggesting that alteration in
sphingolipid metabolism may be

of speciﬁc sphingolipids have been
lacking.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE

At a Glance Commentary
Scientiﬁc Knowledge on the
Subject: In preclinical studies,

ceramides, the basic unit of
sphingolipids, has been linked to
emphysema development. However,
the complexity of the sphingolipid
metabolism generates multiple
sphingolipid species with distinct
biological functions, and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) is a common disease with
multiple phenotypes, including
emphysema. Recent data suggest an
association between circulating and
sputum levels of sphingolipids and
COPD, but only two classes have
been studied (ceramides and
sphingomyelin), and these ﬁndings
have been neither validated in larger
cohorts nor studied in relationship
with distinct COPD phenotypes.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: This study investigates the

associations of plasma sphingolipids
with COPD subtypes such as airﬂow
obstruction, emphysema, chronic
bronchitis, and frequent exacerbations
in a well-characterized cohort of
current or former smokers.
Our ﬁndings add to previous
studies reporting associations of
sphingomyelin and ceramides with
airﬂow obstruction and emphysema.
In addition, we identiﬁed novel
sphingolipids associated with COPD
phenotypes such as frequent COPD
exacerbations. We showed that
COPD subphenotypes are associated
with dysregulated gene/metabolite
pathways for sphingolipids, adding
further evidence to their role in the
pathogenesis of COPD.
Sphingolipids contain a backbone of
sphingoid bases and, depending on the
O-linked R group, are subclassiﬁed into
sphingosines, sphingomyelins, ceramides,
or glycosphingolipids. In mammals, there
are more than 100 species of sphingolipids
and a multitude of enzymes that regulate
sphingolipid metabolism. Sphingolipids are
found primarily in cell membranes, but
also in bioﬂuids such as plasma. Having
pleiotropic effects, speciﬁc sphingolipids
276

have been implicated in diverse biologic
processes (7) that include: cell death,
proliferation, differentiation, autophagy,
senescence, migration, and efferocytosis.
Sphingolipids have been implicated
in several lung diseases, including COPD
(3, 8, 9). The majority of sphingolipid
lung research has focused on ceramides,
the central intermediate metabolites in
the sphingolipid metabolism and key
proapoptotic signaling molecules, and
on sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a
downstream metabolite of ceramide and
key prosurvival and immune regulator.
Smokers (10) and patients with COPD (11)
have increased ceramides in their lungs,
and ceramides have been implicated in
tobacco smoke–induced pulmonary
vascular cell apoptosis (12) and clearance of
apoptotic cells by alveolar macrophages
(13). S1P receptor 5 expression is reduced
the lungs of patients with COPD (14),
and S1P analogs inhibit emphysema
development in animal models (15). Recently,
in a small cohort, sphingolipids were found
elevated in the sputum in COPD (6).
These ﬁndings suggest that
sphingolipid metabolism is dysregulated
by smoking and COPD and that these
derangements may be pathogenic and could
serve as biomarkers (10). However, previous
studies have been limited by small sample
sizes, limited clinical phenotyping, and
limited focus on a particular subclass
of sphingolipids. To overcome these
limitations and further investigate
sphingolipids for their association with
clinical COPD phenotypes, such as
emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and
frequent exacerbations, we used two
mass spectrometry–based approaches to
quantitate 69 plasma sphingolipids in more
than 250 smokers with and without COPD
from the COPDGene study. Furthermore,
we integrated plasma metabolomics analyses
with recently published microarray proﬁling
of this cohort (4) to discover relationships
that might elucidate mechanisms of
sphingolipid dysregulation in COPD.

Methods
Study Population

The institutional review boards of
participating institutions approved this
study. All subjects were from the
COPDGene cohort, which is a National
Institutes of Health–sponsored

multicentered study of the genetic
epidemiology of COPD (16). From this
cohort we selected a subset of 129 subjects
(Table 1) for targeted sphingolipid
analysis to obtain a wide range of COPD
phenotypes (deﬁned below). Additionally,
131 subjects who participated in a
microarray study of gene expression in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (GEO
accession number GSE 42057) (4) were
selected for untargeted sphingolipid
analysis. Additional details are provided
in the online supplement.
Clinical Data Collection and
Deﬁnitions of COPD Phenotypes

Each subject was classiﬁed by four different
clinical phenotypes: airﬂow obstruction
(COPD), chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and
exacerbations (see Table E1 in the online
supplement). COPD was deﬁned using
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive
Lung Disease criteria (17). Emphysema was
measured using quantitative high-resolution
computed tomography (HRCT) as described
(18). Exacerbations were deﬁned by acutely
worse cough, sputum, and dyspnea in those
with and without COPD. Only moderate
exacerbations (treated by corticosteroids
and/or antibiotics) or severe exacerbations
(causing hospitalization) were counted.
Chronic bronchitis was deﬁned as cough that
produces sputum daily for 3 consecutive
months for at least 2 consecutive years.
Sphingolipid Measurements

Sphingolipid measurements were
performed independently in two separate
laboratories using two separate protocols
(see online supplement for more details).
A targeted, quantitative, mass spectrometry
panel (Washington University) included 69
sphingolipids (Table E2). Sphingomyelins,
dihydrosphingomyelins, ceramides,
and dihydroceramides were extracted
using a modiﬁed Bligh-Dyer extraction
method, in the presence of internal
standards. Sphingoid bases, ceramide-1phosphate, monohexosylsphingosine,
monohexosylceramides, dihexosylceramides,
trihexosylceramides, monohydroxylated
monohexosylceramides, monohydroxylated
dihexosylceramides, sulfatides, and
gangliosides were extracted after protein
precipitation with methanol, followed by
supernatant collection, drying, and
reconstituting with 1:1 methanol/water,
in the presence of internal standards. A
second untargeted protocol (National Jewish

statistically signiﬁcant differences in the
baseline characteristics between the
targeted and untargeted cohorts.

Statistical Analysis

Differences in demographic characteristics
of study subjects were analyzed using a t test
for continuous variables and a Chi-square
test for categorical variables. Regression
modeling and covariates are described
further in the online supplement. Because
the sphingolipid levels were highly
correlated within class (Figure E1), we also
computed the ﬁrst principal component
of each sphingolipid class (Tables E3 and
E4) using prcomp function in R.
Replication between the targeted and
untargeted platforms was determined
using the Stouffer-Liptak Z-score method,
which converts the P values from the two
studies to normal quantiles and averages
them to obtain a combined P value (20, 21).
Each of the 23 sphingolipids that
overlapped between the two studies was
tested, and consistency in the direction of
the effect on the phenotype was taken into
account.

Targeted Identiﬁcation of Plasma
Sphingolipids

Our previous results suggested that
sphingolipids were candidate biomarkers
for COPD (4); we therefore performed
targeted measurement of multiple
sphingolipid classes. These included:
sphingomyelins (SM d18:1),
dihydrosphingomyelins (SM d18:0),
ceramides (Cer d18:1), dihydroceramides
(Cer d18:0), sphingoid bases, ceramide-1phosphate, monohexosylsphingosine,
monohexosylceramides, dihexosylceramides,
trihexosylceramides, monohydroxylated
monohexosylceramides, monohydroxylated
dihexosylceramides, sulfatides, and
gangliosides. After ﬁltering out species that
exhibited no or very low peaks, overlapped
with other peaks, exhibited multiple peaks
with retention times in close proximity,
or had large coefﬁcients of variance,
69 sphingolipid species were used for
quantitative comparisons (Table E2).
Multiple sphingolipids were associated with
clinical covariates such as age, sex, body
mass index (BMI), and current smoking
(Table E3). Three sphingolipid species
showed a negative correlation with age
(correlation test P value , 0.01), seven
species showed a negative correlation with
BMI (correlation P value , 0.01), and 32
species showed higher levels in female
subjects (t test P value , 0.01). Although not
signiﬁcant, select species showed trends for

Bowler, Jacobson, Cruickshank, et al.: Plasma Sphingolipids in COPD

alterations depending on current smoking
status. Because of these associations, we
adjusted for covariates in all our models.
Because strong correlations were noted
within classes of sphingolipids (Figure E1),
sphingolipid species were further grouped
into 10 classes (Table E4), which further
revealed robust interclass collinearities.
For instance, plasma sphingomyelins
were strongly correlated with ceramides
(P , 0.001), and both sphingomyelins and
ceramides were inversely correlated with
S1P (P , 0.001). Because of the high
intraclass correlations for plasma
sphingolipids, each class of sphingolipids
was also represented in analyses by the ﬁrst
principal component from the intraclass
principal component analysis.
Plasma Sphingolipids Association
with Different Phenotypes of COPD

Patients with COPD exhibit heterogeneity
in clinical presentation, with different
morbidities and prognoses for each
phenotype; therefore, we investigated if
speciﬁc sphingolipids or sphingolipid
classes are signiﬁcantly associated with
individual phenotypes. The most
statistically signiﬁcant negative (inverse)
association between speciﬁc COPD
phenotypes and sphingolipid classes was
for emphysema and sphingomyelins; the
most statistically signiﬁcant positive (direct)
association was between COPD exacerbations
and trihexosylceramides (Figure 1).
Individual sphingolipids associated with
emphysema. We identiﬁed 26 sphingolipids

that were signiﬁcantly associated with
emphysema after adjustment for covariates,
with 8 remaining signiﬁcant after
adjustment for false discovery rate (FDR)
(Table E5). The most highly represented
group was that of sphingomyelins
(10 species associated with emphysema,
including 5 after adjustment for false
discovery), all of which had negative
associations with emphysema. The three
plasma sphingolipids most signiﬁcantly
associated with emphysema were ceramide
d18.1.N16.0 (P = 0.0006), ganglioside
GM3 d18.1.N16.0 (P = 0.0004), and
sphingomyelin d18.1.N16.0 (P = 0.0009),
all being inversely associated with
emphysema (Figure 2), followed by
monohexosylceramide d18.1.N16.0 (P =
0.002; Table E5). When stratiﬁed by
subjects with less severe airﬂow obstruction
(i.e., milder COPD), the receiver operating

Figure 1. Heat map showing sphingolipids associated with specific chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) phenotypes. Each class was
represented by the first principle component. Emphysema was defined as percent of lung attenuation voxels below 2950 Hounsfield units; chronic
bronchitis was defined by daily productive cough for at least 3 months in the previous 2 consecutive years; exacerbations (severe) were the number of
hospital admissions for a COPD admission in the previous year. Each phenotype was modeled using regression with covariates (age, sex, smoking status,
body mass index, and airflow obstruction [FEV1] where appropriate), detailed in the online methods. The color legend shows shading based on the
signed 210 log of the P value with negative (2) associations shown in blue and green and positive (1) associations shown in orange and red for each

these top sphingolipids improved the ability
to diagnose moderate to severe emphysema
beyond just clinical and physiologic
covariates (Table E6).
Individual sphingolipids associated with
COPD exacerbations. After adjustment for

covariates and correction for FDR, we
identiﬁed 11 sphingolipids that were
associated with severe COPD exacerbations,
including four trihexosylceramides, three
dihexosylceramides, sulfatide d18.1.

sphingomyelin SM.d18.1.N14.1, and S1P
(Table E7). All associations were positive
except for S1P and SM.d18.1.N14.1, and the
strongest signal was the positive association
of severe COPD exacerbations with plasma
trihexosylceramides d18.1.N18.0 (adjusted
P = 1.6 3 1026). Most of these associations
were also identiﬁed with COPD
exacerbations of lesser severity (Table E8).
Receiver operating characteristic analysis
demonstrates that these sphingolipids
improved the ability to diagnose severe
exacerbations beyond just clinical and
278

physiologic covariates (Table E9).
Interestingly, for less severe exacerbations,
only in subjects with less airﬂow
obstruction, Cer.d18.1.N18.0 showed
enhanced association with exacerbations
beyond just clinical and physiologic
covariates (Figure 3 and Table E10).
Sphingolipids associated with other
COPD phenotypes (airﬂow obstruction and
chronic bronchitis). There were no plasma

sphingolipid species signiﬁcantly associated
with chronic bronchitis (Table E11), FEV1
(data not shown), FEV1/FVC (Table E11),
or bronchodilator responsiveness (data not
shown) after correcting for FDR; however,
several metabolomic trends noted in these
subgroups were used in combination with
genomic data for phenotype-metabolomic
interpretations.
Replication of Associations between
COPD Phenotypes and Sphingolipids

For replication, we used an independently
generated metabolomics dataset (detected
via untargeted mass spectrometry using

orthogonal methods in an independent
laboratory) from plasma of 131 subjects in
COPDGene. Between the two datasets, we
identiﬁed 23 overlapping sphingolipids (8
sphingomyelins, 6 ceramides, 3 gangliosides,
2 sulfogalactosylceramides, dihydroceramide,
trihexosylceramide, S1P, and sphingosine).
For overlapping sphingolipids, we performed
metaanalysis of the two datasets accounting
for the direction of association. Seven of 23
sphingolipids showed negative associations
with emphysema, of which ﬁve
sphingomyelins (Table 2) exhibited the
strongest signal for replication between
the two platforms (FDR , 0.10). Four
sphingolipids demonstrated associations
with moderate and severe exacerbations
(Table 3). Except for S1P, all were positively
associated with exacerbations (FDR , 0.10).

from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
collected from the same plasma analyzed
for metabolomics. Thus, we were able to
explore relationships between plasma
sphingolipid metabolites and potentially
related sphingolipid pathway genes (Table
E13). The most signiﬁcant correlations were
between N-(tetradecanoyl)-sphing-4-enine1-(2-aminoethylphosphonate) and GM2
ganglioside activator (r = 20.39; P =
0.00001; FDR = 0.04), between SM(d18:1/
12:0) and lysosomal sialidase (r = 20.36;
P = 0.00007; FDR = 0.12) (Figure E2),
and between sphingosine and CeroidLipofuscinosis, Neuronal 8 (r = 20.34;
P = 0.0002; FDR = 0.03).
After interrogation of correlations
between sphingolipid metabolite and gene
expression and clinical phenotype, subjects
who reported moderate or severe COPD
exacerbations were most likely to have
discordant correlations for gene–metabolite
pairs (Table 4). For example, the
gene–metabolite pair C9orf47 and NeuGca28NeuGca2-3Galb1-4GlcNAcb1-3Galb14Glcb-Cer(d18:1/24:1[15Z]) had correlations
20.19 and 0.64 in subjects without or with
severe COPD exacerbations, respectively
(P = 0.00001; FDR = 0.01) (Figure 4).

in lipid microdomains of caveolae and
clathrin-coated pits (22). Sphingomyelins
are produced from ceramides via
sphingomyelin synthase, or they can
generate ceramides through hydrolysis by
sphingomyelinases (Figure 5). In addition
to rapidly generating ceramides as
second messengers, sphingomyelins
may themselves play a role in cell
migration, apoptosis, autophagy, and cell
survival/proliferation (22). We identiﬁed 10
speciﬁc sphingomyelins (e.g., SM.d18.1.
N16.0) that were inversely associated with
emphysema, whereas others (e.g., SM.d18.1.
N18.0) were not. These species-speciﬁc
effects could only be studied with mass
spectrometry; however, we also noted
strong correlations among the whole
subclass of sphingomyelins. A recent report
(5) found no statistically signiﬁcant
association between HRCT-measured
emphysema severity at baseline and
sphingomyelin, measured with less accurate
spectrophotometric assays (23). However,
low baseline plasma sphingomyelin was
associated with worse COPD (lower FEV1),
whereas high levels were associated with
more rapid progression of emphysema. Our

data support the ﬁnding that worse
COPD is associated with lower plasma
sphingomyelins (5), but the apparent
paradoxical observation of higher plasma
sphingomyelins with progression of
emphysema cannot be validated by our
experimental design. Such observation
might be explained if low sphingomyelin
levels reﬂect low lung mass and progression
of emphysema occurs in lungs that are not
yet severely emphysematous. This could
be explored by careful kinetics of speciﬁc
sphingomyelins accompanied by concomitant
HRCT measurements of the lung.
Plasma ceramides may be generated by
activated plasma sphingomyelinases (24)
(Figure 5) and could signal outside-in
(25) and/or be further metabolized to
sphingosine (by plasma ceramidases).
To the extent that plasma levels reﬂect
cellular metabolism, the decrease in
both sphingomyelins and ceramides
with subsequent increases in ceramide
metabolites suggests that low
sphingomyelin levels are not due to
a blockage in sphingomyelin synthase
(which would result in ceramide
accumulation) but due to increased

catabolism coupled with decreased
availability of its building block precursor,
ceramide (Figure 5). In such conditions,
supplementation of sphingomyelin may
fuel ceramide production and catabolism,
by a “revved up” system. Plasma
sphingomyelins might also reﬂect the
burden or quality of circulating (shed)
cellular plasma membranes, such as
apoptotic microparticles or exosomes.
Clearly, these unbiased metabolomic results
raise important mechanistic questions
that can be explored in models of COPD.
Ceramides (especially Cer.d18.1.
N16.0), gangliosides (especially GM3.d18.1.
N16.0), and monohexosylceramides
(especially monohexcer.d18.1.N16.0) also
showed an inverse correlation with
emphysema. Although ceramides have been
known to play a role in the pathogenesis
of emphysema for several years (10, 26),
the involvement of gangliosides and
monohexosylceramides has not been
described. An up-regulation of ceramide
production has been typically associated
with models of emphysema, by causing
endothelial and epithelial cell apoptosis (3)
or by inhibiting alveolar macrophage
clearance of apoptotic cells (13). In this
cross-sectional sampling, the inverse
correlation of plasma ceramides with
emphysema appears surprising. However,
if our global metabolomics assessment of
plasma sphingolipids reﬂects pulmonary
cellular events, worse emphysema may
be linked to increased activity of both
sphingomyelinase and recycling (from
gangliosides) pathways, followed by
ceramide consumption/degradation, rather
than accumulation (Figure 5), possibly
via plasma ceramidases. Because plasma
S1P was not increased and tended to be
negatively correlated with emphysema and
COPD exacerbations, unlike sphingosine,
it is possible that the sphingolipid
metabolism is accelerated toward ceramide
production and degradation but inhibited
at the level of sphingosine kinase activity
(Figure 5). The reduced production of S1P
may be associated with decreased cellular
survival and proliferation and increased
apoptosis of alveolar cells (15). Much less is
known about the signiﬁcance of decreased
gangliosides (or glycoceramides) in the
lung, reports showing association with
diabetes or hearing loss (27). Although our
earlier genomic analysis hinted at this
involvement (4), this is the ﬁrst report of
decreased monosialodihexosylganglioside

could be explored by comparing plasma with
lung tissue metabolomics signatures.
Because these samples were collected at
a time remote from an actual exacerbation,
metabolomic signatures are unlikely to
reﬂect corticosteroid or antibiotic treatment
or acute infections. Rather, they may

indicate speciﬁc changes associated with
developing COPD exacerbations. For
example, shunting ceramide metabolism
toward trihexosylceramides may render the
lungs more susceptible to inﬂammation, due
to defects in lymphocyte function, as learned
from a mouse model of Fabry disease (31).

of emphysema. Similarly, the role of
monohexosylceramides in the lung is
unknown, but they were shown to bind to
surfactant protein D (28) and to decrease
on activation of acid sphingomyelinase and
acid b-glucosidase1, as a sign of ceramide
production via recycling from gangliosides
during inﬂammation (29). These results
may embolden future investigations of lung
sphingolipid metabolomic signatures and
the functional role of the gangliosides and
monohexosylceramides in COPD.
The strongest positive association
with COPD exacerbations was for
trihexosylceramides (trihexcer.d18.1.N22.0
and trihexcer.d18.1.N24.0), a lipid class with
unknown lung effects; one case report
of Fabry disease (characterized by
overabundance of trihexosylceramides)
showed association with COPD (30). Other
sphingolipids such as ceramide (d18.1.
N18.0) and S1P were inversely associated
with COPD exacerbations. This, along
with negative correlations of plasma
sphingomyelins and ceramides with S1P,
suggests a rapid ﬂux of sphingosine-toceramide-to glycosylated ceramides
metabolism, with potential disruption of
ceramide-to-S1P metabolism (Figure 5)
in those with COPD exacerbations.

Figure 5. Sphingolipids metabolo-genomic pathway patterns associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subphenotypes. (A)
Detailed sphingolipid metabolic pathway with the major ceramide synthetic pathways noted as sphingomyelinase, de novo, and recycling pathways
(abbreviations list in the text). Individual or classes of metabolites measured in the study are identified as precursors and/or products relative to synthetic or
catabolic reactions with directionality marked by black arrows. Catalytic enzymes are noted next to the middle of the reactions arrow. Circled are
enzymes whose genes were significantly related with COPD phenotypes in genomic analyses. In color are classes (arrowheads) or species (arrows) of
metabolites that were associated with respective (color-coded) COPD phenotypes. Solid arrows indicate: 16–18 carbon chain sphingolipids; dotted
arrows 24–26 carbon chain sphingolipids; single dash arrows: 14 carbon chain sphingolipids. The direction of the arrowhead or arrow marks the direction
of association (i.e., up: increased; down: decreased). Closed-headed arrows represent changes with significance levels P , 0.05. (B, C) Superimposed
on the sphingolipid metabolic pathways are deducted directions of sphingolipid metabolic flux, based on the results of the metabolo-genomic study,
by disease phenotype, as noted.

To further translate biomarker ﬁndings
to disease pathogenesis, we explored
alterations of gene–metabolite associations
with disease phenotypes. We identiﬁed
a negative association of sphingosine levels
with the expression of CYR61 only in
subjects with severe COPD. Although the
signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding remains to be
tested, the extracellular matrix protein
CCN1/Cyr61 is activated by S1P via
receptor 2 (32), which also activates rho
kinase to cause lung damage during
cigarette smoke exposure (33, 34). Other
disrupted gene–metabolite associations
of interest in those with severe COPD
exacerbations were between ceramide
and alkaline ceramidase, which degrades
unsaturated long chain ceramides (35);
ORMDL1, which regulates de novo
ceramide biosynthesis, recently
involved in asthma (36); and
282

3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase, which
reduces 3-ketodihydrosphingosine to
dihydrosphingosine (37). Another
intriguing association was that between
circulating ceramide and COL4A3BP,
also known as CERTL, a gene encoding
for ceramide transporter protein
Goodpasture antigen-binding protein,
which mediates the nonvesicular
intracellular transport of ceramides (38).
Superimposing potential sphingolipid
biomarkers with genetic signatures helped
map the directionality of sphingolipid
metabolism in individuals with COPD
exacerbations (Figure 5). Using similar
approaches may strengthen the associations
of sphingolipid metabolism and chronic
bronchitis or obstructive ventilatory
defects in COPD, which were weak at
the plasma metabolite levels, but in
conjunction with genomic ﬁndings

suggested a potential metabolic ﬂux
toward higher S1P and de novo pathway
activation, respectively (Figure E3).
In summary, this study demonstrates
that speciﬁc sphingolipids, such as
ceramides, sphingomyelins, and
gangliosides, may be biomarker candidates
of COPD phenotypes, such as emphysema
and frequent COPD exacerbations. Our
study’s strengths include the large number
of highly phenotyped subjects, the multiple
speciﬁc sphingolipid measurements, and
independent replication. Limitations of our
study include lack of healthy nonsmoking
subjects, of longitudinal studies, and of
lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid, or
sputum analyses. The latter would have
allowed us to probe if plasma ﬁndings
parallel those in the lung and to validate
a small study that suggested sputum
sphingolipids are associated with COPD

(6). Our results in a much larger cohort of
patients with COPD corroborate those
reported in the sputum, in particular that
there are abnormalities in sphingolipid
metabolism and glycosphingolipid changes
in COPD. The complementary nature
of these studies conducted in different
compartments may help interpret our
results in plasma, which indicate an
overall accelerated metabolism/catabolism
of ceramide at the systemic level, in
contrast to the increased ceramides and
dihydroceramides recovered in the sputum
in COPD. This may be due to active transfer

and use of plasma sphingolipids in the
lung with release of ceramides in sputum;
alternatively, it may be due to different
dynamics of sphingolipid metabolism in
circulating cells and endothelium compared
with airway macrophages or epithelial cells
that may contribute to sputum sphingolipid
content.
Our results strengthen the evidence
implicating ceramide in emphysema and
suggest a previously unsuspected role
for ceramide metabolism in COPD
exacerbations. Furthermore, our data
suggest that additional subclasses of
