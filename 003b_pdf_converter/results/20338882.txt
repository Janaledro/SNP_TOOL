ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION

The retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor
(ROR) alpha has been demonstrated to regulate lipid
metabolism. We were interested in the RORa1
dependent physiological functions in skeletal
muscle. This major mass organ accounts for
40% of the total body mass and significant levels
of lipid catabolism, glucose disposal and energy
expenditure. We utilized the strategy of targeted muscle-specific expression of a truncated
(dominant negative) RORa1"DE in transgenic mice
to investigate RORa1 signaling in this tissue.
Expression profiling and pathway analysis indicated
that RORa influenced genes involved in: (i) lipid and
carbohydrate metabolism, cardiovascular and
metabolic disease; (ii) LXR nuclear receptor signaling and (iii) Akt and AMPK signaling. This analysis
was validated by quantitative PCR analysis using
TaqMan low-density arrays, coupled to statistical
analysis (with Empirical Bayes and Benjamini–
Hochberg). Moreover, westerns and metabolic
profiling were utilized to validate the genes,
proteins and pathways (lipogenic, Akt, AMPK and
fatty acid oxidation) involved in the regulation of metabolism by RORa1. The identified genes and
pathways were in concordance with the demonstration of hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance,
attenuated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of
Akt and impaired glucose uptake in the transgenic
heterozygous Tg-RORa1"DE animals. In conclusion, we propose that RORa1 is involved in
regulating the Akt2-AMPK signaling pathways in
the context of lipid homeostasis in skeletal muscle.

Retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptor alpha
(RORa) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor
superfamily of transcription factors. Several in vitro and
in vivo studies on RORa action and function (1–5) have
suggested the involvement of this orphan nuclear receptor
in lipid homeostasis (6) and hepatic phase I/II metabolism
(7). RORa can be detected in many metabolic tissues
including liver, kidney, adipose tissue and is highly
expressed in skeletal muscle. In mice, RORa deﬁciency
leads to profound metabolic disturbances. The homozygous staggerer (sg/sg) mice have a global RORa defect
that results in decreased and dysfunctional expression
of both mouse isoforms of RORa (1 and 4). These
mice display hypoalphalipoproteinemia, dyslipidemia
(decreased serum triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol) (5),
susceptibility to atherosclerosis (2) and reduced adiposity
and resistance to diet-induced obesity (8). The complex
phenotype of the staggerer mice has been demonstrated
to involve underlying changes in the expression of genes
involved in fatty acid homeostasis, i.e. Apo-lipoprotein A1
(ApoA1) (5), Apo-lipoprotein C3 (ApoCIII) (1), sterol
regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c),
ATP-binding cassette transporter-binding proteins A1
and G1 (ABCA1 and G1), peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma co-activator alpha/beta
(PGC-1a/b), lipin1 and beta2-adrenergic receptor (8).
In the context of whole body metabolism, skeletal
muscle has a vital contribution to the maintenance of
energy balance. It is a major mass peripheral tissue with
high energy demands. Consequently, multiple metabolic
pathways converge in this tissue involving the utilization
of both lipid and carbohydrate substrates. Skeletal muscle
is considered a major site of glucose disposal and perturbation of insulin-mediated glucose uptake in this tissue is
an important factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.

In addition, the development of insulin resistance in
skeletal muscle has been associated with increased intramuscular triglyceride accumulation, which can attenuate
several insulin signaling pathways (9). As type 2 diabetes
and associated complications are health issues that have
global signiﬁcance, it is therefore of considerable interest
to investigate the regulatory machinery responsible for
maintaining tight metabolic control in this tissue.
Previously, our analysis of skeletal muscle from staggerer mice (8) identiﬁed diﬀerential expression of a number of
genes involved in fatty acid homeostasis. In this study, we
aimed to investigate the role of RORa in skeletal
muscle, without the complex interactions that result
from the global defect. Therefore, we generated a transgenic mouse that overexpressed truncated human
RORa1DE (lacking the ligand-binding domain) in
skeletal muscle to investigate the contribution of this
energy demanding tissue to the RORa phenotype. We
used a three-pronged genomic approach, utilizing
llumina expression proﬁling, Ingenuity function and
pathway analysis, and validation by rigorous quantitative
PCR (qPCR) analysis on the TaqManÕ low density array
(TLDA) platform. This demonstrated that RORa has an
important role in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism in skeletal muscle. In particular, this animal
model demonstrated that RORa1 also plays a critical role
in skeletal muscle insulin signaling and glucose tolerance,
via modulation of Akt2 and adenosine monophosphate
kinase (AMPK) expression and activity. This correlated
with increased expression of phospho ACC and genes
involved in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. In conclusion, we propose that in skeletal muscle RORa1 is an
important metabolic regulator, contributing to both
glucose and fatty acid homeostasis.

mice from the ﬁfth generation onward, relative to wt
littermates; therefore the genetic background of the
animals in this study is >98.6% C57Bl/6J. The initial
characterization was performed on both transgenic lines.
No diﬀerences were observed in either phenotype or metabolic gene expression between the two lines, therefore we
continued investigation on one line only.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously (4). We utilized custom
designed ABI microﬂuidic TLDAs to analyze the expression of genes involved in metabolism (lipid, carbohydrate
and energy homeostasis). Three control genes were
utilized, including the mandatory control (18S rRNA)
and four other controls: Gapdh, GusB, Hprt1 and 36B4.
These controls span the relative abundance/Ct range of
the genes on the card, and three (18S rRNA, GAPDH
and 36b4) are approved real time PCR controls for
NURSA supported nuclear receptor studies (15,16). The
TLDAs were analyzed as described in Myers et al. (17).
Brieﬂy, signiﬁcant changes in expression relative to wt
littermate mice were analyzed using the ABI/integromics
‘StatMiner’ software package. Diﬀerentially expressed
genes were identiﬁed by linear models (contained in the
LIMMA package for bioconductor R embedded in
StatMiner). Signiﬁcance was assigned by the application
of the Empirical Bayes statistic. B values represent the
empirical bayes log odds of diﬀerential expression, and
the t-value is the empirical bayes moderated t-statistic.
Subsequently, we applied a more stringent/conservative
data ﬁltering (Benjamini–Hochberg) to control for false
discovery rate, correct P values and further reﬁne the
subset of diﬀerentially expressed genes.

Production of transgenic-mouse
The transgenic vector construct encodes a truncated
version of human RORa1 (RORa1DE). Amino acids
1–235 are present but the entire E region and part of the
hinge/D region have been removed as previously described
(3). To confer muscle speciﬁcity, the vector was placed
under the control of the full-length human skeletal
alpha-actin (HSA) promoter as described previously
(10–12). Zygotes were generated by pronuclear microinjection of the transgene into oocytes from hybrid female
donors (C57BL/6J X CBA) as described (13). Screening
of founder mice and their oﬀspring for stable germ line
transmission was performed by real time PCR. The sequences of the speciﬁc mouse RORa and human RORa
primers were as follows—hRORa: CAATGCCACCTA
CTCCTGTCC and CTACGGCAAGGCATTTCTGT
AAT, mRORa: CAATGCCACCTACTCCTGTCC and
GCCAGGCATTTCTGCAGC. Transgene copy number
was determined using real time PCR as described (14).
Two founders were selected for analysis, each of which
carried two copies of the transgene. Both lines were then
backcrossed with C57Bl/6J mice for a minimum of ﬁve
generations. Experiments were performed on transgenic

Animal procedures
The mice were housed in the QBP vivarium (University of
Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia) with 12 h
light–dark cycle and fed a standard diet containing 4.6%
total fat (from Specialty Feeds, Glen Forrest, Western
Australia). For the diet-induced obesity experiments,
mice were transferred to a high-fat diet containing
34.9% fat (D12492, Research Diets, New Brunswick,
NJ) from 4 weeks of age onward. Experimental animals
were weighed weekly up to 14 weeks of age. Mice were
fasted overnight by transferring to a new food-free
holding cage with unrestricted access to water, prior to
all experimental procedures. Care was taken to euthanize
all animals at 9 am (i.e. 3 h into the light cycle, and at
similar times), and excised tissues were immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at 80 C. All
aspects of animal experimentation were approved by The
University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee.

Protein extraction
Total soluble protein was extracted from skeletal muscle
(quadriceps) by the addition of lysis buﬀer (10 mM Tris
(pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mM
EDTA) containing protease and phosphatase ‘cocktail’
inhibitors (Roche diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany). Lysates were passed through a 26-gauge
needle and centrifuged at 10 000g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was
determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA assay kit),
as outlined by manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce
Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL, USA).
Glucose and insulin tolerance tests and glucose uptake
Basal glucose measurements were obtained from the tail
blood of overnight fasted animals (14–16 weeks of age).
Mice were then administered a dose of either glucose
solution (2 g/kg) or insulin (0.5 U/kg) by intraperitoneal
injection. Blood glucose measurements were obtained at
10 or 15 min intervals for up to 90 min following challenge
using the Accu-Chek Performa blood glucose testing
system (Roche Diagnostics Australia, Castle Hill, NSW).
Plasma insulin measurements were obtained using the
insulin (mouse) Ultrasensitive EIA (ALPCO Diagnostics,
Salem NH). Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was performed on skeletal muscle (extensor digitorum longus,
EDL) dissected from anesthetized mice and incubated in
essential buﬀer (Krebs–Henseleit, pH 7.4) and the assay
was performed as described previously (18,19).
Western blot analysis
Total soluble protein from the quadriceps of transgenic
and their littermate wild-type mice were resolved on a
10% SDS–PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF
(Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA in TBS–Tween 20,
followed by an overnight incubation with primary
antibody. The following antibodies were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA and used at
1:1000 dilution: AMPKa (#2532), pAMPK (Thr172)
(#2535), Akt (#9272), pAKT (ser473) (#4058), ACC
(#3662) and pACC(Ser79) (#3661). Anti-GAPDH
(1:10000) was from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN.
Following 3  10 min washes, the membrane was
incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
(1:10000) for 1 h. Immunoreactive signals were detected
using enhanced chemiluminescence Super Signal West

Pico Substrate (Pierce) and visualized by autoradiography
on an X-OMAT ﬁlm developer (Kodak).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
C2C12 cells were diﬀerentiated for 4 days. Cells were harvested and subsequently washed twice in ice cold PBS and
cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde solution. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as described
by Pearen et al. (20) using anti-RORa (Santa Cruz
anti-RORa sc-6062) and IgG (Santa Cruz, CA). The following qPCR ChIP primers were used: RORRE Site 1 F—

Statistical analysis
The TLDA gene expression data were analyzed as
described above. All other results were analyzed (and signiﬁcance assigned) using a t-test, or ANOVA in the
Graphpad Prism 4 software, unless otherwise indicated.
RESULTS
Overexpression of truncated RORa1"DE (lacking the
ligand-binding domain) in skeletal muscle
As discussed, RORa has been demonstrated to regulate
fat metabolism in several tissues. We were interested in
identifying and validating the (physiologically relevant)
in vivo functional role(s) and pathway(s) regulated by
RORa action in skeletal muscle. This major mass peripheral tissue accounts for 40% of the total body mass,
signiﬁcant levels of fatty acid oxidation, glucose disposal
and energy demand. We utilized the approach of
attenuating RORa signaling, by the targeted skeletal
muscle-speciﬁc expression of a truncated RORaDE
(lacking the ligand-binding domain) in transgenic mice,
to examine RORa action in this tissue. This approach
was utilized in the absence of the availability of a reproducible and robust, native or synthetic agonist for the
modulation of this orphan nuclear receptor.
We produced transgenic mice (by pronuclear injection)
that selectively express a transgene encoding truncated
human RORa1 in skeletal muscle [under the control of
the human skeletal alpha actin promoter (10,11)]. The
transgene (RORa1DE) lacks the ligand-binding
domain and part of the hinge region, and encoded
amino acids 1–235 (6). McBroom et al. (21) reported
that deletion of this segment preserved DNA recognition
and binding, suppressed trans-activation and operated in
a dominant negative manner. In addition, Hamilton et al.
(22) reported the staggerer mutation is located in a similar
position, and produces a non-functional ligand-binding

domain. Moreover, we previously demonstrated in an
in vitro myogenic cell culture model that this construct
attenuated RORa mediated trans-activation, and ectopic
expression suppressed endogenous RORa mRNA expression (3).
We observed that the heterozygous transgenic mice predominantly (and abundantly) expressed the ectopic transcript (transgene) in skeletal muscle relative to other
organ/tissues (cerebellum, spleen, heart, white adipose,
liver and pancreas; Figure 1A and B). Heart and brain
expressed <2% of the ectopic transcript, relative to expression in skeletal muscle. This was consistent with
several other studies that utilized this promoter in transgenic models (10,12,23). Quantitative real-time PCR
(q-PCR) analysis of mRNA expression demonstrated
that the ectopic truncated RORa transcript was expressed
between 3- and 4-fold higher than the endogenous RORa
transcript in the muscle of transgenic mice (Figure 1A). As
expected, the ectopic RORa transcript was not detectable
in wt littermates (data not shown). Concordantly, expression analysis demonstrated that total (endogenous plus
ectopic) RORa transcript expression increased 3-fold
in the muscle of transgenic, relative to wt littermate mice
(Figure 1C). In this background we observed a decrease
(that did not attain signiﬁcance) in the levels of total endogenous RORa1 and 4 mRNA expression in the muscle

of transgenic relative to wt littermate mice (Figure 1D).
Surprisingly, isoform-speciﬁc q-PCR analysis of RORa1
and RORa4, revealed signiﬁcant suppression of RORa1
(but not a4) mRNA expression (Figure 1E and F). Staels
(1,5) and our group (3,8) amongst others have previously
demonstrated that the a1 isoform has a physiological role
in the regulation of lipid homeostasis. To further characterize the line of mice, we examined expression of a bona
ﬁde RORa (1 and 4) target gene, apolipoprotein A5,
characterized by two independent groups (24,25), which
was very signiﬁcantly decreased in the Tg-RORa1DE
mice (Figure 1G). These data demonstrate the line of
Tg-RORa1DE mice, express the ectopic transcript,
suppress endogenous RORa1 mRNA expression and attenuate RORa1-dependent gene expression.

RORa1"DE mice: identiﬁcation of functions and
pathways
To rigorously identify the in vivo functional role(s), and
pathway(s) regulated by RORa action in skeletal muscle,
we carried out expression proﬁling coupled to functional
and signaling characterization by Ingenuity pathway
analysis (Supplementary Figures S2–S5). Using a P
value cut-oﬀ of P < 0.05 and a fold change cut oﬀ of

expressed genes in Tg-RORa1DE mice were involved
in/associated with lipid metabolism, small molecule transport and biochemistry, cardiovascular and metabolic
disease, carbohydrate metabolism, endocrine system disorders etc (see Supplementary Figure S4), in concordance
with the pathophysiological role of NRs. The majority of
metabolic genes are down regulated in the major functional categories of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism
(Supplementary Figure S4 and S5). This is consistent
with several investigations in RORa deﬁcient mouse
models (2,8). In the framework of this investigation, the
primary signaling pathways regulated in skeletal muscle
were the glutathione metabolism (responsible for the
tight control of ROS levels, which modulate insulin sensitivity), type 2 diabetic signaling and fatty acid

RXR-dependent) pathways including LXR, FXR VDR
and PXR were identiﬁed in the analysis. The higher
ranked NR signaling pathways control lipogenesis/fatty
acid biosynthesis (LXR) and cholesterol homeostasis
(LXR and FXR) in agreement with the functional annotation (see Supplementary Data S4 and S5). The majority
of diﬀerentially expressed genes were associated with lipid/
carbohydrate metabolism and metabolic disease
(Supplementary Data S5A).

biosynthesis/lipogenesis) functions and pathways were
highly ranked. We have validated the illumina/genespring
analysis by rigorous qPCR analysis utilizing a
custom-designed ABI microﬂuidic TLDA, that encoded
taqman primer sets for critical metabolic genes involved
in the control of lipid homeostasis. Speciﬁcally, in the
context of lipogenic gene expression, TLDA analysis
revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerential expression (normalized
against 18S rRNA) of the mRNAs encoding acyl-CoA
synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4), fatty
acid translocase/cluster of diﬀerentiation 36 (FAT/
CD36), fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearyl-coA dehydrogenase 1 (SCD-1), SREBP-1c and many other genes in the
skeletal muscle of male Tg-RORa1DE mice relative to
wild-type littermates (assigned by the Empirical Bayes
statistic, see Table 3, Supplementary Data S6—
Supplementary Figure S6 shows the complete list).
Stringent ﬁltering of data using the Benjamini–Hochberg

method to control P value false discovery rate (FDR)
reﬁned the signiﬁcant subset of diﬀerentially expressed
genes to SREBP-1c, FAS, SCD-1, ACSL4, CD36 and
HIF1a (Figure 2A and Table 3).
Subsequently, we used (manual) qPCR to examine (and
validate) the expression of several other genes in the lipogenic pathway that were identiﬁed in the illumina analysis
as signiﬁcant, diﬀerentially expressed targets. The
Tg-RORa1DE mice also displayed signiﬁcantly
reduced expression of the mRNAs encoding the nuclear
hormone receptor, LXRa (Figure 2B), a critical transcriptional regulator of SREBP-1c and the genetic program
that regulates lipogenesis. Interestingly, the expression of
both FAS and SCD-1 (responsible for the synthesis of
de novo fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids,
respectively) was also decreased. These genes are downstream targets of LXRa and SREBP1c (the master transcriptional regulators of the genetic program that

We identiﬁed that the expression of the two mRNAs
encoding tail interacting protein (Tip47) and di-acyl
glycerol acetyl transferase 2 (Dgat2) were signiﬁcantly
reduced in the male Tg-RORa1DE transgenic mice
relative to wild-type littermate pairs (Figure 2C and D).
In summary, we observed qPCR validation of the master
transcriptional regulators of fatty acid biosynthesis (LXR
and SREBP-1c) and several important downstream target
genes (including FAS and SCD-1).
The observation of attenuated LXR expression and
decreased downstream target gene expression was consistent with the identiﬁcation of this NR signaling cascade in
the pathway analysis (Supplementary Figures S4 and S5).
We explored the NR signaling pathways more rigorously
by performing qPCR analysis utilizing a custom-designed
ABI microﬂuidic TLDA that encoded taqman primer sets
targeting all 48 mouse NRs. The analysis revealed small,
but signiﬁcantly reduced (1.5–2.5-fold) expression of the
mRNAs encoding the nuclear hormone receptors: LXRa,
TR2, PPARd, GR and RORg in the Tg-RORa1DE
mice, relative to the wt littermates (Figure 2E, Table 3
and Supplementary Figure S7 shows the complete list of
nuclear hormone receptors). Please note increased RORa
expression in the Tg-RORaDE was not detected because
the TLDA was mouse speciﬁc and the transgenic line expressed the truncated human transcript.
In summary, parallel analysis by illumina, ingenuity and
qPCR on the TLDA platform have demonstrated that
RORa in skeletal muscle leads regulates the lipogenic/
fatty acid biosynthetic pathway.

expression were not observed in either liver or adipose
tissue (data not shown).
In addition, we analyzed several genes that are involved
in intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) accumulation.

Pathway analysis revealed the involvement of RORa
expression in carbohydrate metabolism and type 2
diabetic signaling, and that truncated RORa expression
eﬀected Akt2 mRNA levels (Supplementary Figures S2,
S4 and S5A). This led us to further examine the expression
of critical genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism
using the custom-designed ABI microﬂuidic TLDA to
perform qPCR analysis. We identiﬁed statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerential expression of several important genes that
control insulin signaling and glucose uptake (Table 3,

wild-type littermates. TLDA analysis revealed the expression of the mRNAs encoding Akt2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 3 and 4 (Pdk3 and 4), and several other
genes were signiﬁcantly reduced in the skeletal muscle of
male Tg-RORa1DE mice relative to wild-type
littermates (see Table 3, Supplementary Figure S8.
Subsequently, after correction/adjustment of P values according to the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method, Akt2
remained the only transcript that was signiﬁcantly and
diﬀerentially expressed (and repressed) in the
Tg-RORa1DE line (see Table 3, Supplementary Figure
S8 and Figure 3A). It should be noted that the data (prior
to FDR ﬁltering) has been derived from sensitive qPCR

on metabolic genes. Assignment of signiﬁcance prior to
application of FDR analysis is relatively robust.
Subsequently, we also assessed the expression of the
other Akt family members. Although Akt2/PKB was signiﬁcantly decreased in the skeletal muscle of male
Tg-RORa1DE mice relative to wild-type littermates,
we observed no change in the expression of the mRNAs
encoding, Akt1 or 3 (data not shown). Notably, no signiﬁcant changes in gene expression were observed in either
liver or adipose tissue after TLDA analysis (data not
shown). In addition, we investigated whether attenuation
in Akt2 mRNA expression correlated with changes in the
protein levels of total Akt and phosphorylated (ser473)
Akt/PKB using western analysis (Figure 3B). We
observed a signiﬁcant decrease in total Akt/PKB protein
in the Tg-RORa1DE mice relative to wild-type
littermate pairs (Figure 3B and C), corresponding with
the mRNA expression data. Moreover, the levels of the
active phosphorylated (ser473) Akt species were also signiﬁcantly decreased (Figure 3B and D). Akt/PKB is a
critical target in the regulation of GLUT4-[solute carrier
family 2a (facilitated glucose transporter), member 4]

mediated glucose uptake. In summation, corresponding
investigation by illumina, qPCR (on the TLDA
platform) and western analysis have demonstrated that
RORa in skeletal muscle regulates Akt2 mRNA, protein
and phosphorylation. This is consistent with the high
ranking of carbohydrate metabolism and type 2 diabetic
signaling by the ingenuity platform.
Expression of truncated RORa in skeletal muscle induced
mild hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance: attenuated
insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt in the
Tg-RORa1"DE mice
Suppression of (total and phospho) Akt in skeletal muscle
suggests the mouse model may display increased plasma
glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. We conducted
several experiments to characterize the phenotypic (and
metabolic eﬀects) of aberrant RORa expression in
skeletal muscle to validate the results of the illumina/ingenuity analysis.
The transgenic mice presented with no gross or histological phenotypic abnormalities, although they did
appear to be slightly smaller than their wt littermates.

Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 13 4305

However, growth curve analysis from 4 to 14 weeks indicates that both male and female Tg-RORa1DE mice on
a regular chow diet showed no signiﬁcant reductions in
body weight, relative to wild-type littermate pairs
(Figure 3E). All subsequent studies were performed on
male mice.
We subsequently measured blood glucose and observed
mild hyperglycemia in the transgenic mice, with increased
fasting glucose levels in male transgenic mice relative
to wild-type littermate pairs (Figure 3F). This is consistent
with decreased (total and phospho) Akt (mRNA
and protein) levels in skeletal muscle. We further
examined systemic glucose metabolism, and performed
intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests. In the
Tg-RORa1DE mice, glucose clearance was signiﬁcantly
delayed following a glucose challenge (Figure 3G). No
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in plasma insulin levels between
the transgenic and wt mice (on regular chow diets) were
detected (data not shown). Furthermore, the glucose excursions displayed by Tg-RORa1DE compared to
wild-type mice during an insulin tolerance test were comparable (Figure 3H). Moreover, no diﬀerences in plasma
insulin concentration were observed either at baseline or
ten minutes subsequent to glucose administration (data
not shown).
We subsequently examined whether skeletal musclespeciﬁc expression of Tg-RORa1DE mice played a
role in insulin signaling. Protein extracts were
isolated from saline and insulin injected (littermate pairs
of) wt and Tg mice and subsequently analyzed by
immunoblot analysis using Ab’s speciﬁc to Akt2 and
phospho- Akt2.
Quantiﬁcation of the western blots (Figure 4E and F)
demonstrated that there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
(basal) total Akt2 levels in between saline and insulintreated wild-type and Tg animals. As expected, insulin
treatment in wild-type mice signiﬁcantly stimulated the
levels of phosphoS473Akt2 relative to saline treated
mice (3-fold Figure 4A and B). However, we observed
that insulin treatment did not signiﬁcantly increase phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 in the male Tg-RORa1DE
mice (Figure 4C and D, respectively).
Furthermore, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin
stimulation of Akt phosphorylation did not involve (or
result in) signiﬁcant changes in GLUT 2, 4 or 8 mRNA
expression (determined by qPCR-microﬂuidic TLDA
analysis, see Supplementary Figure S7). GLUT1 mRNA
expression was analyzed independently by qPCR, and
data presented as a footnote in Supplementary Figure
S8. The expression of the mRNAs encoding Glut1, 4
and 8 was decreased by 20%, however, after Bayes
and FDR analysis, these changes did not attain signiﬁcance (Supplementary Figure S8).
In the context of the hyperglycemia, impaired glucose
tolerance and insulin stimulation of Akt phosphorylation,
we investigated whether ex vivo glucose uptake was
aﬀected
by
transgenic
RORDE
expression.
(Figure 4E). In wild-type type 2 (fast twitch glycolytic
EDL, Figure 4E) skeletal muscle, glucose uptake was
increased 2-fold by insulin treatment. Similar results
were observed in soleus muscle (data not shown).

In contrast, in the Tg-RORa1DE mice, glucose uptake
did not signiﬁcantly respond to insulin treatment
(Figure 4E).
To further explore the molecular basis of aberrant Akt2
mRNA, protein and phospho AKt expression in the transgenic Tg-RORa1DE mice, we examined the mouse Akt2
promoter sequence (as reported on the Ensembl site) for
putative RORE elements. Interestingly, we identiﬁed
three putative ROR response elements (RORREs)
between nucleotide positions, 2900 to 2600 bp
upstream of the transcription start site that were concordant with the optimal RORa1 binding site,
R A A A R A
=Y =T =T =T =Y =T RGGTCA as described by Giguere
et al., (26). (Figure 5A and B). In order to determine
whether RORa was selectively recruited to the putative
ROR responsive elements (NR1, 2 and 3) within the
mouse Akt2 promoter, we designed three sets of primers and one set of negative primers downstream of
the putative sites within the promoter (Figure 5)
for ChIP in skeletal muscle cells. It was observed that
the RORa antibody [using anti-RORalpha (Santa Cruz
anti-RORa sc-6062)] eﬀectively immunoprecipitated
the NR1 (2859/2853) and NR2 (2655/2649
[and to a lesser extent the NR3 (2626/2620)] motifs
relative to IgG, and the no antibody controls
(Figure 5C). The speciﬁcity of RORalpha recruitment to
these NR half sites was underscored by the lack of recruitment, i.e. the failure to immunoprecipitate the negative
control region further downstream between nucleotide
positions 278/177 [1.6-kb downstream of these
putative RORE sites, (Figure 5C)]. In summary, these
data clearly demonstrate that RORa is recruited directly
to the mouse Akt2 promoter, and suggest the direct functional involvement of RORa1 in the regulation of AKt2
expression.
In summary, parallel analysis by illumina, ingenuity,
qPCR and western and metabolic analysis has
demonstrated that RORa expression in skeletal muscle
regulates Akt expression (and phosphorylation state),
blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance and insulinstimulated Akt2 phosphorylation and glucose uptake.

Reduced Akt correlates with increased levels of phospho
(thr172)-adenosine monophosphate kinase in
Tg-RORa1"DE mice
Recent research has demonstrated that Akt2/PKB is a
potent negative regulator of AMPK activity (Figure 6A)
in murine cardiac muscle and ﬁbroblasts (27,28).
Secondly, ingenuity interrogation of the illumina data
identiﬁed AMPK signaling as a signiﬁcantly regulated
pathway. Therefore, we undertook western analysis of
the basal and phosphorylated AMPK species (Figure
6B). We detected no change in total AMPK protein
levels (Figure 6B and C). However, phosphorylated
T172 AMPK levels were signiﬁcantly elevated in skeletal
muscle from Tg-RORa1DE mice (Figure 6B and C).
The increased levels of phospho-AMPK are entirely consistent with reduced Akt2 activity.

previously (18,19). *P < 0.05, NS, not signiﬁcant.

We further investigated the levels of the basal and
phosphorylated AMPK species AMPK in homozygous
staggerer (sg/sg) mice that lack RORa in all tissues (in
contrast, to the muscle-speciﬁc overexpression of the
dominant negative). We detected a slight but signiﬁcant
1.5-fold increase in total AMPK protein levels (Figure
6D and E) in sg/sg mice relative to wt littermates.
However, the levels of phosphorylated T172 AMPK
levels did not change in the skeletal muscle tissue from
the sg/sg mice relative to wt littermates (Figure 6D and
E). In summary, transgenic and muscle-speciﬁc

overexpression of RORa1DE leads to elevated levels
of phospho-AMPK.
Elevated phospho-AMPK in Tg-RORa1"DE mice
leads to increased phosphoACC Levels, and increased
PGC-1a and CPT-1b mRNA expression
The literature reports that the positive eﬀect of activated
AMPK on fatty acid oxidation is mediated by phosphorylation of Acetyl CoA carboxylase ACC (and decreased
production of malonyl CoA) (see Figure 7A). Moreover,

Expression of the truncated orphan nuclear receptor,
RORa1 had minimal eﬀects on important skeletal
muscle markers of ﬁber type and muscle mass
We utilized qPCR-TLDA analysis to assess whether the
expression of the truncated receptor aﬀect markers of contractile function, ﬁber type and muscle mass (see Table 3,
Supplementary Figure S9). Speciﬁcally, in this context,
TLDA analysis revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerential expression
of the mRNAs encoding histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5),
transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (Tgfbr1) and
several other genes (including Mef2a/d, Tnni2 and
Acvr2A) in the skeletal muscle of male Tg-RORa1DE
mice relative to wild-type littermates (see Table 3,
Supplementary Figure S9) when normalized against 18S
rRNA. However, following the application of conservative data ﬁltering using the FDR–Benjamini–Hochberg
algorithm, only HDAC5 (1.25-fold) and Tgfbr1
(2.5-fold) survived as signiﬁcant (but weak) decreases in
expression (Table 3, and Supplementary Figure S9). This
suggested that the changes in glucose tolerance, insulin
signaling and lipogenesis were not indirect eﬀects of
changes in muscle mass and/or contractile function.

AMPK activators increase the expression of PGC-1a and
PPARa target genes, for example CPT-1 in skeletal muscle
(29,30). Consequently, we were particularly interested to
assess whether increased expression of activated AMPK
resulted in the induction of phosphoACC (Ser79) and two
critical genes associated with fatty acid oxidation in the
skeletal muscle of the Tg-RORa1DE mice.
We undertook analysis of the basal and phosphorylated
ACC species (Figure 7B). We detected a signiﬁcant change
in total ACC protein levels (Figure 7B). More importantly, phosphorylated ACC levels (detected by western blot)
were signiﬁcantly elevated in skeletal muscle from
Tg-RORa1DE mice (Figure 7B and C). qPCR analysis
revealed the signiﬁcant (diﬀerential) expression of the
mRNAs encoding PGC-1a (Figure 7D) and CPT-1b

DISCUSSION
The biochemical and molecular characterization of RORs
in cell culture and animal models has revealed that RORs
play a critical role in the modulation of lipid homeostasis
in a tissue-speciﬁc manner (1–5,31,32). Our previous
studies reported that homozygous (male and female) staggerer mice (with decreased and dysfunctional expression
of RORa in all organs) display reduced adiposity and are
resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity. The lean phenotype of staggerer mice was associated with signiﬁcantly
increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (including PGC-1, lipin1, etc.), and signiﬁcantly
reduced expression of SREBP-1c (and several lipogenic
genes) in all major metabolic tissues.
Surprisingly, studies investigating the role of RORa in
the regulation of glucose homeostasis have not been
reported. In this context, we were particularly interested
in exploring the role of RORa1 in skeletal muscle, a major
mass peripheral tissue that accounts for the majority of
glucose disposal and lipid catabolism. We probed the role
of RORa signaling in this major mass peripheral tissue, by
the skeletal muscle-speciﬁc overexpression of truncated
RORa1DE (lacking the ligand-binding domain) to investigate the contribution of this peripheral tissue to the
RORa phenotype. This construct has been described to
operate in a dominant negative manner in several
reports (21,22). This strategy also allows the probing of
RORa-dependent gene expression in the absence of an
identiﬁed native and/or synthetic ligand.

The human skeletal a-actin promoter was utilized to
construct the muscle-speciﬁc vector. This promoter
has been demonstrated to function in a cell/tissuespeciﬁc manner (10,11). As expected the transgene,
RORa1DE, was eﬃciently and speciﬁcally expressed in
skeletal muscle of transgenic mice relative to other organ/
tissues. Second, our RORa1DE expression vector
retains the native RORa1 amino-terminal AF-1 domain
(i.e. AB region) and the native zinc ﬁnger region; these
properties ensure that the NR targets the native RORa1
response elements in the skeletal muscle of transgenic
mice. Giguere et al. (26) demonstrated that each ROR
isoform displays isoform-speciﬁc DNA binding, and the
amino-terminal domain and the zinc ﬁnger region work in
parallel to confer sequence-speciﬁc DNA recognition and
binding.
Expression proﬁling, coupled to analysis on the ingenuity platform identiﬁed a RORa1-regulated subset of genes
that were involved in or associated with lipid metabolism,
small molecule transport and biochemistry, cardiovascular
and metabolic disease, carbohydrate metabolism, endocrine system disorders etc. This is in concordance with
investigations in RORa-deﬁcient mouse models and
in vitro promoter/cell culture investigations that have
demonstrated the involvement of RORa in a number of
physiological process including atherosclerosis, lipid
homeostasis, fat deposition, obesity, inﬂammation,
immunity, etc (6). In the framework of this investigation,
the primary signaling pathways regulated in skeletal
muscle were glutathione metabolism (that tightly
controls ROS levels and modulates insulin sensitivity),
type 2 diabetic signallng and fatty acid biosynthesis.
Notably, the LXR signaling (and RXR dependent)
pathway was identiﬁed in the analysis, which controls
lipogenesis and cholesterol homeostasis.
In concordance with the array analysis, qPCR analysis
on the TLDA platform revealed signiﬁcantly attenuated
expression of the mRNAs (encoding the hierarchical regulators of lipogenesis), LXRa and SREBP-1c and several
other downstream target genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in skeletal muscle. For example, we observed
decreased expression of the downstream target genes,
SCD1 and FAS. Moreover, in the context of lipogenesis,
we observed the suppression of Ascl4, Dgat2, Tip47,
HIF-1 and Cd36. Acsl4, the long chain acyl CoA
synthetase, plays an important role in lipid metabolism
by routing fatty acids to several diﬀerent metabolic
pools. Decreased Acsl4 expression is associated with
decreased triglycerides and fatty acids partitioning to diand tri-acyl glycerol (33,34) and consistent with reduced
Dgat2 (that catalyzes the ﬁnal step in triglyceride production) and Tip47 (a perilipin family member that
co-ordinates the storage of triacylglycerol (35).
Furthermore, it has been reported that decreased Dgat2
expression is associated with reduced expression of
SREBP-1c and SCD-1 and increased CPT-1 expression
(see below), in concordance with our observations (36).
Finally, suppression of HIF-1alpha is associated with
reduced fatty acid uptake and biosynthesis, and in concordance with the suppression of the genetic program

controlling lipogenesis and the decrease in the fatty acid
translocase, CD36 (37).
In the context of the decrease in LXR and other NR
signaling pathways, we completed TLDA analysis of the
entire NR supergene family. This analysis identiﬁed decreases in the expression of the mRNAs encoding GR,
PPARd, TR2 and RORg. These nuclear receptors have
been implicated in the regulation of lipid homeostasis.
We did not observe decreases in THR(a / b), FXR,
VDR, etc. that were identiﬁed by ingenuity. We suggest
that the detection of these pathways by ingenuity reﬂects
secondary consequences of RORa-mediated dysregulation
and the aberrant expression of NRs identiﬁed above.
As discussed, ingenuity analysis of the array data
identiﬁed carbohydrate metabolism as a signiﬁcantly
regulated
function.

tg-RORa1DE mice display signiﬁcantly increased
fasting plasma glucose levels, impaired glucose tolerance
and attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake relative
to wild-type littermates. Our qPCR TLDA proﬁling
identiﬁed the signiﬁcantly decreased expression of the
mRNA encoding Akt2/PKB in skeletal muscle, after
Bayes assignment of signiﬁcance and stringent FDR ﬁltering. Furthermore, the total amount of Akt and
phospho-Akt protein was signiﬁcantly reduced. In this
context, several studies have demonstrated that, Akt2
plays a critical role in insulin-mediated glucose disposal
in skeletal muscle. For example, Cho et al. (38)
demonstrated that disruption of the Akt2 gene expression
in mice was associated with insulin resistance and type2
diabetes-like syndrome. Subsequently, Garofalo et al. (39)
showed mice lacking Akt2/PKB gene displayed a diabetic
phenotype and age-dependant lipodystrophy.
Interestingly, the mild hyperglycemia (in the fasted
state), glucose intolerance and impaired glucose uptake
occur without any signiﬁcant change in whole body
insulin sensitivity (i.e. the insulin tolerance test) and/or
change in GLUT1 and four expression. First, this does
not appear to involve an insulin secretion defect as the
transgene is not expressed in the pancreas and the mice
develop hyperinsulinemia after a high-fat challenge (data
not shown). It should be noted that muscle-speciﬁc
deletion of an essential component (rictor) of the mTOR
complex 2 leads to the attenuation of insulin-induced
phosphorylation of Akt2 at Ser473. Moreover, these
mice displayed glucose intolerance, however, insulin sensitivity remained unchanged (40). Similarly, our
Tg-RORa1DE mice displayed an attenuated insulinmediated Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt and glucose
uptake. In this context, Gonzalez and McGraw (41)
demonstrated that ‘insulin signalling diverges into
Akt-dependent and independent signals’. James and colleagues (42) recently stated that several studies underscore
the pivotal role of Akt2 in GLUT4 function; however,
many gaps remain in understanding the signaling
cascades involved. For example, similar inconsistencies
(between impaired glucose uptake and/or normal glucose
tolerance and insulin sensitivity) have been described in
other animal models that have perturbed expression
and/or knockout in critical genes that regulate glucose
homeostasis.

ChIP analysis revealed RORal was directly involved in
the regulation of Akt2. We identiﬁed several potential
RORa1 response elements in the mouse Akt2 promoter
between 2900 and 2600 nt upstream of the transcription start site. These sites were accommodated by the
A A R A
motif R =A
Y =T =T =T =Y =T RGGTCA described by Giguere
et al. (26), as an optimal RORa1-binding site. ChIP
identiﬁed functional RORa1 recruitment to three sites
(in close proximity) within this region. Further characterization of the Akt2 promoter is required to elucidate the
mechanism mediating regulation by RORa1.
Ingenuity identiﬁed AMPK signaling as a regulated
pathway in the Tg mice overexpressing the dominant
negative RORa1. It has been well established that
AMPK is master regulator of energy homeostasis
through the suppression of ATP-consuming lipogenic
pathways and by the enhancement of ATP producing
catabolic pathways, including fatty acid oxidation in
skeletal muscle tissue (43,44 and references therein).
Moreover, Akt2/PKB is a potent modulator of AMPK
activity. For example, Hahn-Windgassen et al. (28)
showed that Akt/PKB regulates intracellular ATP levels
through regulating AMPK activity. Furthermore,
Planavila et al. (45) showed that mice treated with
troglitazone (PPARg agonist) in skeletal muscle were
associated with increased Akt2/PKB and decreased
AMPK activity. Moreover, recent investigations on
Akt2/PKB and AMPK pathways in heart tissue showed
that Akt2/PKB is a negative regulator of AMPK activity
(27). Finally, the association between increased AMPK
activity and the reduction of lipogenic gene expression
and genes regulating fatty acid oxidation is well documented (46–49). Furthermore, the inhibitory eﬀect of
potent AMPK activators such as aminoimidazole
carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) or Metformin on
lipogenesis in skeletal muscle has been described in both
human and rodents (29,30). Consequently, in the context
of our studies, we were particularly interested in
examining the cross-talk between lipid homeostasis (lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation), Akt2 signaling (and
glucose tolerance) and AMPK signaling in a background
of aberrant RORa1 (NR) signaling.
Interestingly, the hyperglycemia and signiﬁcantly
decreased Akt2 (mRNA and protein) and phosphoAKT
levels in the Tg-RORa1DE mice are associated with
increased phosphoAMPK levels, in concordance with
the studies discussed above. This is consistent
with studies demonstrating type 2 diabetic patients also
display normal AMPK signaling (50,51). Paradoxically,
some studies report that increased AMPK activity
mediates (only exercise induced) glucose transport.
However, AMPK null mice exhibit typical exercise
stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and AICAR
does not induce glucose transport in muscle (52).
Interestingly, we did not observe increases in pAMPK in
the skeletal muscle of staggerer (sg/sg) mice that lack
RORa expression in all tissues (although we observed
mild elevation in the levels of basal/total AMPK).
Diﬀerential AMPK activity in these lines is not completely
unexpected for several reasons. Firstly, we are comparing
a line of mice overexpressing dominant negative RORa1

(in skeletal muscle), against a line of mice lacking RORa1
expression. Second, in mice lacking NR expression, genes
(and/or phenotypes) maybe silenced or derepressed depending on cofactor requirements, expression and/or
promoter characteristics (53).
The increased AMPK activity in the Tg-RORa1DE
mice did not only correlate with decreased Akt activity,
but was also consistent with (i) attenuated mRNA expression of LXRa and SREBP-1c, and several other genes
involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in skeletal muscle
(44,54,55) and (ii) induction of the genes/pathways
increasing fatty acid oxidation (56). For example, SCD1
deﬁciency has been reported to be associated with
increased AMPK activity, fatty acid oxidation and
reduced ceramide synthesis (41,42,57). In addition, in
this interconnected regulatory milieu, we observed
increased expression of two critical regulators of fatty
acid oxidation, PGC-1a and CPT1b, concomitant with
elevated levels of phospho-Ser79 ACC in the
Tg-RORa1DE mice, relative to the wt littermate mice.
This is also consistent with the observations (47–49,56 and
references therein) that activated AMPK and AMPK
agonists regulate PGC-1 and pACC expression.
Finally, overexpression of truncated RORa in skeletal
muscle resulted in very minor changes in the expression of
genes regulating muscle mass, proliferation and diﬀerentiation. Interestingly, the analysis did identify HDAC5 as a
diﬀerentially expressed gene. A recent study has
demonstrated the link between AMPK, energy balance
and transcriptional regulation of GLUT4 expression
mediated by HDAC5. That study indicated that increased
AMPK activity induced HDAC phosphorylation that
reduces HDAC5 association with the GLUT4 promoter.
Interestingly, in our mouse model, although insulin
mediated phosphorylation of Akt2, and glucose uptake
was perturbed; the association between increased AMPK
activity and HDAC5 was maintained.
In conclusion our investigation reveals that the orphan nuclear receptor RORa operates at the nexus of
pathways controlling the association between lipid
homeostasis (lipogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation), Akt2
signaling (glucose tolerance and uptake) and AMPK
signaling.
