Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A naturally occurring p53 isoform that lacks 39 residues at the N-terminus (denoted ΔNp53),
when expressed with wild-type p53 (WTp53), forms mixed ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers and causes
accelerated aging in mice. Cellular alterations specific to ΔNp53:WTp53 have been difficult to
assess because ΔNp53 and WTp53 co-expression results in tetramer heterogeneity, including
formation of contaminating WTp53 tetramers. Based upon the p53 tetramer structure, we
expressed ΔNp53 and WTp53 as a single transcript that maintained tetramer architecture, ensuring
a 2:2 ΔNp53:WTp53 stoichiometry. As expected, ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers were stable and
transcriptionally active in vitro and in cells, largely mimicking the function of WTp53 tetramers.
Microarray analyses, however, revealed about 80 genes whose expression was altered 2-fold or
more in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells. Moreover, global metabolomic profiling quantitated hundreds of
biochemicals across different experiments (WTp53, ΔNp53:WTp53, plus controls). When
evaluated collectively, these data suggested altered mTOR signaling and mitochondrial function—
each canonical regulators of longevity—in cells expressing ΔNp53:WTp53 vs. WTp53. Increased
levels of free amino acids, increased expression of IRS-1, and decreased expression of INPP5D/
SHIP-1 suggested activated mTOR signaling in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells; this was confirmed upon
comparative analyses of several mTOR pathway intermediates. We also observed changes in
mitochondrial function in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells, which correlated with increased MARS2
expression and elevated levels of carnitine, acetyl CoA, ATP, and Krebs cycle intermediates.
Finally, elevated levels of succinate and 2-hydroxyglutarate indicate potential epigenetic means to
propagate ΔNp53:WTp53-induced gene expression changes to cell progeny. This may be
especially important for aging, as biological effects manifest over time.

occurring p53 isoforms that lack the N-terminal p53 activation domain, when expressed
together with wild-type p53 (WTp53), cause a progeroid phenotype that includes early-onset
osteoporosis, memory loss, and premature death (Maier et al., 2004; Pehar et al., 2010;
Tyner et al., 2002). The molecular mechanisms by which ΔNp53 cause accelerated aging
remain incompletely understood. It is clear, however, that ΔNp53 requires WTp53 to
mediate its physiological effects; mice expressing only ΔNp53 do not age rapidly (Maier et
al., 2004). Because p53 binds DNA as a tetramer, the formation of mixed ΔNp53:WTp53
hetero-tetramers is believed to mediate the accelerated aging phenotype (Courtois et al.,
2002). Although ΔNp53 has been well studied using knock-in mouse models, ΔNp53 has not
been thoroughly studied in human cells. Moreover, global gene expression and metabolic
changes induced by ΔNp53:WTp53 have not been assessed in human cells or any model
organism. One potential reason for this is that co-expression of ΔNp53 and WTp53 will
confound analyses due to heterogeneity, including formation of “contaminating” WTp53
tetramers. As one consequence, it has been difficult to define cellular changes that are
specifically dependent upon ΔNp53:WTp53, because a means to examine a single entity
with fixed ΔNp53:WTp53 stoichiometry was not evident. For these reasons, the underlying
mechanisms that link ΔNp53 and its progeroid phenotype remain incompletely understood,
even in model organisms.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further define the molecular pathways impacted by ΔNp53 expression in human cells, we
expressed 2:2 ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers (i.e. two copies of ΔNp53 and two copies of WTp53
per tetramer) in p53-null H1299 cells. Based upon the p53 tetramer structure (Okorokov et
al., 2006), we implemented a strategy that expressed ΔNp53 and WTp53 as a single
transcript that maintained the native tetramer architecture, ensuring a 2:2 ΔNp53:WTp53
stoichiometry. These ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers were stable and transcriptionally active in
vitro and in cells, largely mimicking the function of WTp53 tetramers. Microarray analyses
identified 84 genes whose expression was up- or down-regulated 2-fold or more in
ΔNp53:WTp53 cells compared with WTp53. This set of genes included many with
established roles in longevity and metabolism. We next completed global metabolomic
profiling, which identified and quantitated hundreds of biochemicals across different
experiments (WTp53, ΔNp53:WTp53, plus controls). When evaluated collectively, the gene
expression and metabolomics data provided clear predictions (validated via pathway
analyses) about cellular processes disrupted by ΔNp53:WTp53 expression. Among the most
striking were mitochondrial function and the mTOR pathway, each well-established
regulators of longevity. Biochemical and cellular assays confirmed a hyper-active mTOR
pathway and altered mitochondrial function in cells expressing ΔNp53:WTp53 (vs. WTp53).
We also uncovered metabolites whose elevated levels could contribute to heritable
epigenetic changes upon ΔNp53:WTp53 expression. Because ΔNp53 is a naturally occurring
isoform whose levels can increase with cell stress, the ΔNp53-induced changes identified
here could play a role in normal human aging.

Results
Expression and purification of 2:2 ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers
The p53 activation domain (p53AD) resides in the N-terminus of the protein. Two separate
activation motifs have been identified, with residues 14–26 comprising p53AD1, and
residues 41–57 comprising p53AD2. Thus, the ΔNp53 isoform lacks p53AD1 but retains
p53AD2. The structure of the native p53 tetramer indicates that p53 assembles as a dimer of
dimers, with the C-terminus of one p53 polypeptide interacting with the N-terminus of a
second p53 protein (Okorokov et al., 2006). The juxtaposition of the N- and C-termini
suggested that a flexible linker could tether two p53 monomers to yield a 1:1 ΔNp53:WTp53
dimer (Fig. S1). Implementing the strategy outlined in Figure 1A, we expressed a tethered
ΔNp53:WTp53 protein as a single transcript in insect cells. Purification of p53 tetramers

from these cells matched that of WTp53 tetramers; in particular, ΔNp53:WTp53 migrated
similar to the native p53 tetramer on a size-exclusion column (Fig. 1B). Silver stain and
western blot analysis (Fig. 1C) revealed a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa,
consistent with a tethered ΔNp53:WTp53 dimer. For functional comparisons, we purified
WTp53 tetramers and tetramers consisting of only ΔNp53 proteins (Fig. 1D).
ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers are functionally equivalent to WTp53 in vitro
To compare the activity of the 2:2 ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers (hereafter called
ΔNp53:WTp53) with WTp53 tetramers, we used an in vitro transcription system
reconstituted from purified human factors (Knuesel et al., 2009). An outline of the assay is
shown in Figure 2A. Transcription activation at the native HDM2 promoter was assessed in
the absence of p53, or in the presence of WTp53 tetramers, ΔNp53 tetramers, or
ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers. As expected, transcription activation required Mediator and
WTp53 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 – 3); ΔNp53 tetramers, which lack p53AD1 but retain
p53AD2, were unable to activate transcription (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 – 6). By contrast, the
ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers could activate HDM2 transcription equally well compared with
WTp53 (Fig. 2B, lane 7). This result demonstrated that ΔNp53:WTp53 had an inherent
activity equal to WTp53, at least in this cell-free reconstituted transcription assay.
Evaluation of ΔNp53:WTp53 in cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To establish whether ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers would bind a p53-regulated promoter in
cells, we expressed either WTp53 or ΔNp53:WTp53 in p53-null H1299 cells and performed
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP). As shown in Figure 2C, both WTp53 and
ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers bound the p21 (CDKN1A) promoter at the consensus p53 binding
sites. Because WTp53 and ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers each contain four intact DNA-binding
domains, these data were not unexpected. Note that the p53 antibody (DO-2) used for ChIP
targets residues 10–16, which are absent in ΔNp53. Consequently, the occupancy of
ΔNp53:WTp53 appears reduced because 50% fewer epitopes are present. Next, we used RTqPCR to measure p21 (CDKN1A) expression. The p21 gene represents one of only a few
genes thus far identified as differentially expressed (reduced expression relative to WTp53)
in cells expressing both ΔNp53 and WTp53 (Powell et al., 2008; Ungewitter & Scrable,
2010). In agreement, we observed a decrease in p21 expression, relative to WTp53, in cells
expressing ΔNp53:WTp53 (Fig. 2D). We also examined p21 expression in H1299 cells
expressing matched levels of both ΔNp53 and WTp53 (i.e. as separate transcripts). Whereas
the stoichiometry of p53 tetramers could not be controlled with such experiments, p21
expression in these “ΔNp53 + WTp53” cells showed a decrease relative to WTp53 that was
similar to ΔNp53:WTp53 cells (Fig. 2D).

ΔNp53:WTp53 induces a gene expression program slightly distinct from WTp53
Having confirmed that tetramers assembled from ΔNp53:WTp53 were stable, could bind
p53-regulated promoters in cells, and were transcriptionally active in vitro and in cells, we
next assessed their impact on global gene expression patterns. We used p53-null H1299
cells, which do not express any p53 isoform at detectable levels. Expression of p53 (WTp53
or ΔNp53:WTp53) was achieved by transfection using a vector that enabled bicistronic
expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP); this allowed p53-expressing cells to be
sorted by GFP fluorescence. Prior to harvesting RNA for microarray analysis, we confirmed
that p53 protein levels (WTp53 or ΔNp53:WTp53) were matched by quantitative western
blot (Fig. S2A). Also, at the time of the analysis, each cell population (WTp53,
ΔNp53:WTp53, or controls) displayed similar cell cycle distribution, as revealed by flow
cytometry (Fig. S2B); relative levels of apoptosis and senescence were measured in each
cell population, and only live cells were isolated (Fig. S3).

Microarray analysis was completed for four different samples: mock transfection (reagent
only), empty vector (reagent plus GFP vector), WTp53, and ΔNp53:WTp53. The gene
expression profile for cells expressing WTp53 (compared with mock or empty vector
controls) yielded predictable results, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the
genes differentially expressed in WTp53 cells identified canonical p53-regulated processes,
as expected (Fig. S4). The overall gene expression profiles of WTp53 vs. ΔNp53:WTp53
were similar when compared with control (GFP vector only) cells, as shown by the Venn
diagrams in Figure S5 as well as the GSEA (Fig. S4). These similarities were not
unexpected, as ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers retain all four DNA-binding domains and only
differ in two of four activation domains. About 80 genes, however, showed greater than 2fold differences in expression in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells (up or down, compared with WTp53).
These genes are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Several hundred genes showed altered
expression at levels 1.5-fold or greater in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells, compared with WTp53.
These genes are shown in Table S1 and S2. The expression levels of numerous genes listed
in Table 1 and 2 were probed independently using qRT-PCR. These experiments verified the
microarray results (Fig. S6).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also used qRT-PCR to probe expression of numerous genes in Saos-2 cells. Like H1299
cells, Saos-2 cells are p53-null. Because p53-induced gene expression patterns are not
identical in different cell types, we expected to observe some differences in transcription
response (Espinosa, 2008). As shown in Figure S7, most, but not all, genes probed by qRTPCR showed similar changes in expression levels in Saos-2 cells compared with H1299
cells.
The peptide linker itself does not alter biological function of p53
Collectively, the data in Figure 1 and 2 indicated that the flexible peptide linker inserted
between ΔNp53 and WTp53, which was based upon the p53 tetramer structure (Okorokov et
al., 2006), did not affect the biological activity of ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers. To further
address whether the linker itself might impact p53 function, we expressed tethered WTp53
tetramers (i.e. WTp53:WTp53) in p53-null H1299 cells. In other words, WTp53 dimers
were expressed as a single transcript using the same linker sequence used for
ΔNp53:WTp53. Microarray analyses were then completed in which we compared global
gene expression changes induced by “standard” WTp53 vs. its tethered counterpart (i.e.
WTp53:WTp53). These and other data, summarized in Figure S8A–J, indicate that the
peptide linker itself does not appear to direct gene expression changes or otherwise alter
WTp53 function, at least within the duration of these experiments.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In agreement with these findings, we performed qRT-PCR experiments in H1299 cells coexpressing equal levels of ΔNp53 and WTp53 (i.e. ΔNp53 + WTp53). As anticipated, and in
agreement with data for p21 (Fig. 2D), gene expression from these “ΔNp53 + WTp53” cells
was largely similar to ΔNp53:WTp53 cells (Fig. S9 and S10). Importantly, in cases where
differences were observed, these could be attributed to tetramer heterogeneity (e.g. WTp53
tetramers) resulting from ΔNp53 and WTp53 co-expression (see legend, Fig. S8, S9 and
S10).
Global metabolomics analyses
Whereas many genes up- or down-regulated in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells are directly or indirectly
linked to aging, a significant fraction are involved in basic metabolic processes (Table 1 and
Table 2). Given the major role that p53 plays in regulating cell metabolism (Feng & Levine,
2010; Vousden & Ryan, 2009), we compared the metabolomes of H1299 cells expressing
WTp53 or ΔNp53:WTp53. The metabolomics analysis utilized an analytical platform that

combines gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) mass spectrometry
(GC-MS and LC-MS/MS) techniques (Reitman et al., 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Six biological replicate samples were prepared for metabolic profiling. In addition to
WTp53 and ΔNp53:WTp53, we evaluated mock and GFP vector only transfected H1299
cells. Because cell cycle changes or changes in cell state (e.g. apoptosis or senescence) could
potentially alter metabolite levels, we probed samples to ensure viability and that each cell
population was similar in cell state and cell cycle distribution (Fig. S2B and S3). As with
microarray analyses, we also confirmed that p53 levels were consistent and comparable in
WTp53 vs. ΔNp53:WTp53 samples by quantitative western blot (Fig. S2A). A statistical
summary of the biochemicals identified in each sample is shown in Table S3; a complete list
of the metabolites identified, including statistical parameters and absolute or relative
quantitation, is provided in Table S4.
Metabolic changes associated with WTp53 support roles in tumor suppression and
metabolism

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Relative to control cells (WTp53 vs. GFP vector; Table S3) 142 biochemicals were
categorized as significantly altered in H1299 cells expressing WTp53 (p ≤ 0.05). As
anticipated, the metabolic alterations induced by WTp53 support its known roles as a
metabolic regulator and tumor suppressor (Vousden & Ryan, 2009). Although the primary
focus of this study was how the ΔNp53 isoform altered WTp53 function, we highlight the
metabolic changes induced by WTp53 in Table S5.
Metabolic changes associated with ΔNp53:WTp53 vs. WTp53
Compared with WTp53, the levels of 94 biochemicals were altered (p ≤ 0.05) in cells
expressing ΔNp53:WTp53 (Table S3). Many intriguing results emerge from these data, and
several key findings are highlighted in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3A, amino acid levels
were uniformly elevated in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells, compared with WTp53. Moreover,
derivatives of these amino acids (e.g. N-acetylated forms) were more abundant in
ΔNp53:WTp53 cells (Table S4). Figure 3B shows a subset of biochemicals whose levels
were increased or decreased in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells, including carnitine and its derivatives,
TCA/Krebs cycle intermediates, and glutathione metabolites.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Elevated amino acids are known to activate the mTOR pathway, which acts as a nutrient
sensor and regulates lifespan in yeast, worms, flies, and mammals (Laplante & Sabatini,
2012). Moreover, elevated levels of TCA intermediates and carnitine (Fig. 3B), which is
critical for transporting fatty acids within mitochondria, suggested alterations in
mitochondrial function in cells expressing ΔNp53:WTp53. As with the mTOR pathway,
mitochondrial function is strongly linked to mammalian aging (Vendelbo & Nair, 2011).
Given the number of genes and metabolites altered in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells relative to cells
expressing WTp53, pathway analyses were completed as an additional means to evaluate the
data. Results are summarized in Table S6 – S9 and further implicate mTOR and
mitochondrial function in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells. Therefore, we decided to probe
ΔNp53:WTp53 cells for changes in mitochondrial function and mTOR signaling.
Altered mitochondrial function in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells
Gene expression (e.g. MARS2, CYBRD1) and metabolic changes (Fig. 3B) suggested
altered mitochondrial function in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells (Bayat et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2010).
Carnitine is critical for transporting fatty acids within mitochondria; subsequent β-oxidation
of fatty acids generates acetyl CoA, NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2, in turn,
provide electrons that drive mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation

(Fig. 4A). The increase in carnitine and its intermediates suggested that mitochondrial
function (in particular, ATP production) might be altered in cells expressing ΔNp53:WTp53.
Gene expression changes may contribute to the increased carnitine levels in ΔNp53:WTp53
cells; for example, the lysine methyltransferase DOT1L and the iron import protein
CYBRD1 were up-regulated over 2-fold (Fig. 4A).
To determine whether mitochondrial function might be altered in H1299 cells expressing
ΔNp53:WTp53, we measured mitochondrial membrane potential using Mitotracker Red. As
shown in Figure 4B, cells expressing ΔNp53:WTp53 display increased Mitotracker staining,
indicative of a greater potential difference across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The
apparent increase in membrane potential did not result from an increased number of
mitochondria in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells, because no significant changes in mitochondrial DNA
content were observed in cells expressing WTp53 vs. ΔNp53:WTp53 (Fig. 4C). Together,
these data confirm that an increase in membrane potential accompanies ΔNp53:WTp53
expression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mitochondrial membrane potential is generated via electron transport, which establishes a
proton gradient that helps drive ATP synthesis. The increased membrane potential (Fig. 4B)
suggested that ATP production might be enhanced in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells. To assess ATP
levels, we implemented a quantitative, luciferase-based assay. This analysis revealed an
~50% increase in ATP production in cells expressing ΔNp53:WTp53 relative to WTp53
(Fig. 4D), consistent with the increased mitochondrial membrane potential shown in Figure
4B. Collectively, the data in Figure 4 (see also Fig. S11) indicate an activity for
ΔNp53:WTp53 that alters mitochondrial function in a manner distinct from WTp53.
Upregulation of mTOR pathway in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The across-the-board elevation in amino acids (Fig. 3A) suggested the mTOR pathway was
activated in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells. Amino acids are known to activate mTOR via an elaborate
mechanism involving lysosomes and a set of Rag GTPases (Laplante & Sabatini, 2012).
Hyperactive mTOR signaling was further supported by the gene expression data, which
indicated increased expression of IRS-1 and decreased expression of INPP5D/SHIP-1 in
ΔNp53:WTp53 cells, compared with WTp53 (Table 1 and Table 2). As shown schematically
in Figure 5A, IRS-1 activates PI3K to generate phosphoinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate; this
serves to activate AKT kinase, an upstream activator of mTOR. Similarly, decreased
expression of the 5-position inositol phosphatase INPP5D would promote phosphoinositol
(3,4,5) triphosphate signaling by limiting its breakdown to phosphoinositol (3,4)
diphosphate. In addition, reduced expression of LYN (which activates INPP5D) in
ΔNp53:WTp53 cells (Table S2) could contribute to mTOR activation through a variety of
mechanisms (Baran et al., 2003; Gardai et al., 2002).
To test whether the mTOR pathway was up-regulated in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells, we probed for
well-established markers of mTOR activation, including phospho-S6 kinase,
phospho-4EBP-1,2,3, and phospho-mTOR. Levels of the phosphorylated intermediates were
compared with total mTOR and CCNC, as shown in Figure 5B. Phospho-S6 kinase,
phospho-4EBP-1,2,3, and phospho-mTOR were uniformly increased in ΔNp53:WTp53
H1299 cells, compared with cells expressing WTp53 (Fig. 5B). We next evaluated levels of
mTOR pathway intermediates in a different p53-null cell line, Saos-2. As shown in Figure
5C, phosphorylated mTOR, phospho-S6K, and phospho-4EBP-1,2,3 were each elevated in
Saos-2 cells expressing ΔNp53:WTp53 compared with WTp53. Taken together, the data in
Figure 5 (see also Fig. S12) demonstrate that ΔNp53:WTp53 expression activates the mTOR
pathway in human cells. This outcome is opposed to WTp53, which suppresses mTOR
signaling (Feng & Levine, 2010).

Discussion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The p53 transcription factor is expressed in most cell types, plays important roles throughout
development, and helps sustain basic cellular functions, such as stress response. Whereas
myriad factors influence aging, this study focused on the naturally occurring human ΔNp53
isoform, whose expression causes accelerated aging in mice (Maier et al., 2004; Tyner et al.,
2002). To more thoroughly understand the distinct activities of human ΔNp53, we focused
on differences relative to WTp53. Our goal was not to distinguish direct from indirect
effects of ΔNp53, but rather to gain insight into the cellular pathways altered by its
expression. A key feature of this study was analysis of ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers with fixed
2:2 stoichiometry; this circumvented confounding issues associated with ΔNp53 and WTp53
co-expression and allowed clear delineation between WTp53 and ΔNp53:WTp53. Another
key feature was the combination of gene expression and metabolomics data, which allowed
better assessment of pathways altered by ΔNp53:WTp53. On their own, gene expression
data correlate poorly with organismal aging. Age-associated changes in gene expression are
heterogeneous and vary with cell or tissue type (Bahar et al., 2006; Somel et al., 2006).
Also, age-associated gene expression changes are not consistent across model organisms
(Zahn et al., 2007). Signaling and metabolic pathways, however, are more consistently
linked to aging across different cell types and even model organisms (Vijg & Campisi,
2008). Collectively, our data suggest that in human cells, ΔNp53:WTp53 helps orchestrate
changes in basic cellular processes that contribute to aging. In fact, mitochondrial function
and mTOR signaling are linked to longevity in organisms as distinct as mammals and yeast
(Laplante & Sabatini, 2012; Vendelbo & Nair, 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We would like to point out some advantages and limitations of our study. Whereas the
metabolomics analyses complemented the gene expression data and provide a wealth of
information, they do not offer a fully comprehensive view of cellular alterations that
accompany ΔNp53:WTp53 expression. The total number of chemically distinct metabolites
in human cells exceeds a few thousand (Wishart et al., 2009), whereas we identified several
hundred in this study. We also cannot delineate the cellular location of each metabolite, or
its lifetime within each cell. Furthermore, non-coding RNAs can affect gene expression and
cell physiology, and it remains unclear how ΔNp53:WTp53 affects expression of non-coding
RNA genes. The effect of ΔNp53:WTp53 vs. WTp53 on H1299 cell growth, cell cycle, or
senescence was essentially identical; however, a ~10% difference was observed in annexin
V staining (early apoptosis). This could make some contribution to gene expression and
metabolic differences between ΔNp53:WTp53 and WTp53 cells; however, our analyses
focused on large-scale changes (typically 2-fold or greater) such that it is unlikely a major
contributing factor. Consistent with this, phenotypic changes (e.g. mitochondrial membrane
potential or mTOR signaling) were insensitive to removal of annexin V-positive cells and
were consistent at 24 or 41 hours following ΔNp53:WTp53 or WTp53 expression. We
acknowledge that the gene expression and metabolic changes induced by ΔNp53:WTp53
have similarities with aging studies in model organisms. Aging is controlled by a complex
array of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, however, and the data shown here
focus only on ΔNp53:WTp53-dependent changes. Thus, our results will not correlate with
all aging studies completed in model organisms. Moreover, the bulk of our analysis was
completed in a single cell type. Although this has obvious advantages (isogenic; identical
culture conditions) and avoids physical and physiological heterogeneity inherent in young
vs. old comparisons, the ΔNp53:WTp53-induced changes identified here may not be
identical in distinct cell types or contexts.
Analysis of ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers as a single entity

ΔNp53 and WTp53 as a single transcript while preserving p53 tetramer architecture. As
expected, the flexible peptide linker—which was longer than necessary to enable
conformational variability—did not notably affect the biological activity of p53, as tethered
versions of WTp53 (i.e. WTp53:WTp53) mimicked phenotypic and gene expression
changes induced by native WTp53 tetramers. Similarly, ΔNp53:WTp53 formed stable
tetramers, bound p53 target sequences in cells, activated transcription similar to WTp53 in
vitro, and displayed similar activity to co-expressed ΔNp53 + WTp53 in cells. It has been
postulated that translation of p53 generates homo-dimers, followed by post-translational
tetramer formation (Nicholls et al., 2002). Based upon this model, the structural organization
of 2:2 ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers would be slightly distinct, with one WT dimer merging with
one ΔNp53 dimer. Whether this assembly mechanism predominates in cells remains unclear,
in part because few studies have directly addressed this question, likely due to its enormous
practical and technical challenges. The similar gene expression changes induced by
ΔNp53:WTp53 compared with ΔNp53 + WTp53, however, suggest that either these
potential architectural distinctions have little functional consequence, or that the linked
ΔNp53:WTp53 tetramers evaluated here represent a predominant tetramer architecture.

Expression of linked ΔNp53:WTp53 dimers to ensure a 2:2 tetramer stoichiometry offered
several advantages over co-expression of ΔNp53 and WTp53 (i.e. ΔNp53 + WTp53).
Because ΔNp53:WTp53 stoichiometry cannot be controlled with separate co-expression
(even when each protein is present at similar levels), up to five distinct entities could form,
ranging from zero to four copies of ΔNp53 within any given tetramer. The strategy
employed here avoided this heterogeneity, and ensured the presence of a single entity in
which the ΔNp53:WTp53 stoichiometry was kept constant. Equally important, our strategy
ensured that gene expression and metabolomics data would not be confounded by the
presence of contaminating WTp53 tetramers that result from ΔNp53 and WTp53 coexpression. Thus, the gene expression and metabolomics comparison between
ΔNp53:WTp53 and WTp53 completed here enabled a clear contrast that would simply not
be possible with any series of co-expression studies.
Neomorphic function of human ΔNp53

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mutations can cause a gain- or loss-of-function in a transcription factor that modify its effect
on global gene expression patterns; such “neomorphic” mutations are well documented for
p53 (Freed-Pastor & Prives, 2012). In general, the effects of ΔNp53:WTp53 vs. WTp53 in
H1299 cells were largely indistinguishable. Only a subset of genes were differentially
expressed, and only minor changes, if any, were observed upon assessing cell growth,
apoptosis, cell cycle, or senescence. Potentially, ΔNp53:WTp53 could gain functions that
promote growth; however, this was not evident based upon our observations with cultured
cells or from the gene expression and metabolomics data. Based upon our comparative
analyses with WTp53, alterations in mTOR signaling and mitochondrial function appear to
represent neomorphic outcomes of ΔNp53:WTp53 expression. Whereas WTp53 is a
negative regulator of mTOR signaling (Feng & Levine, 2010), this function appears to be
lost with ΔNp53:WTp53. Up-regulation of the mTOR pathway appears to result—at least in
part—from altered gene expression (IRS-1, INPP5D) and metabolic changes (amino acids)
in cells expressing ΔNp53:WTp53.
Potential mechanisms that underlie the mitochondrial changes (e.g. increased membrane
potential) can also be deduced from the metabolic and gene expression data. In addition to
carnitine and its role in mitochondrial fatty acid transport, we observed an up-regulation of
MARS2, the mitochondrial tRNAmet synthetase, which suggests enhanced translation of
mitochondrial proteins in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells. Because translation initiates with the Met
codon, it has been proposed that elevated levels of tRNAmet up-regulate translation
(Marshall et al., 2008). Increased translation of mitochondrial proteins, in particular those

involved in electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, could result in the observed
increase in membrane potential and ATP. Mitochondrial function is also sensitive to iron. In
ΔNp53:WTp53 cells, we observed increased levels of glutathione and its derivatives, along
with altered expression of the heme transporter SLC46A1 and the iron reductase/iron import
protein CYBRD1. Glutathione is essential for regulating iron metabolism (Kumar et al.,
2011), and increased levels of glutathione metabolites, coupled with changes in iron importexport factors, suggests that iron homeostasis might be disrupted in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells.
Mitochondrial function is highly dependent upon iron, in part because many proteins and
protein complexes important for electron transport contain iron-sulfur clusters. In fact,
glutathione is required for proper biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters (Lill, 2009).
Given the well-studied roles of the mTOR pathway and mitochondrial function in longevity,
our results with ΔNp53:WTp53 are consistent with its accelerated aging phenotype in mice
and implicate the naturally occurring ΔNp53 isoform as a potential regulator of human
aging.
Potential links between ΔNp53 and normal physiological aging

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A growing number of studies indicate that single metabolites are sufficient to trigger
phenotypic changes in cells and within an organism. To cite a few examples, acetate can
correct insulin signaling defects (Shin et al., 2011) and choline can promote atherosclerosis
(Wang et al., 2011). The metabolic changes induced by ΔNp53:WTp53 expression are
striking and encompass a limited set of pathways. We observed that amino acids, urea cycle
intermediates, polyamines, and glutathione metabolites were significantly elevated in cells
expressing ΔNp53:WTp53, relative to WTp53. Numerous studies have linked these same
metabolites to aging and longevity in mammalian model organisms; however, far fewer
studies have addressed the metabolic changes that accompany human aging. A metabolomic
study of human plasma isolated from healthy old vs. young donors shows clear similarities
to our metabolomic comparison of ΔNp53:WTp53 and WTp53 (Lawton et al., 2008). As
seen in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells, amino acid levels were uniformly increased in old vs. young
human plasma samples, as were polyamines, carnitine, TCA cycle, and urea cycle
metabolites. Potentially, these shared features could reflect a distinct metabolic signature in
aged human cells that is rapidly adopted upon ΔNp53 expression. Much additional work will
be needed to rigorously test this hypothesis.

Among the various models for mammalian aging, a common theme includes stochastic,
heritable changes that gradually alter gene expression patterns and metabolic pathways
(Martin, 2009). Such mechanisms appear to represent a fundamental requirement for aging,
as biological effects manifest over time. Because ΔNp53 is a naturally occurring isoform, its
levels could change with age. Existing gene expression data have limited value, however, as
ΔNp53 levels are controlled primarily by alternate translation (Candeias et al., 2006; Ray et
al., 2006). In mice, relative levels of ΔNp53 change with developmental state (Ungewitter &
Scrable, 2010), and several reports indicate that human ΔNp53 protein levels change during
cell stress (Bourougaa et al., 2010; Candeias et al., 2006; Courtois et al., 2002). The links to
cell stress imply that transient increases in ΔNp53 levels can occur throughout the human
lifespan.
Could transient elevation of ΔNp53 levels have chronic, long-term consequences? We note
two potential mechanisms by which transient ΔNp53 expression could initiate a selfreinforcing cascade, with possible implications for aging. First, it is established that ER
stress increases relative levels of ΔNp53 vs. WTp53 in human cells by favoring alternate
translation initiation from an IRES within the WTp53 mRNA (Bourougaa et al., 2010).
Elevated levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) can independently induce an ER stress
response (Sasaki et al., 2012). Because 2HG is elevated in ΔNp53:WTp53 cells, ΔNp53

could promote its own translation by inducing ER stress. Second, we observed elevated
levels of succinate and 2HG in cells expressing ΔNp53:WTp53, as well as increased
expression of the histone H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L. This suggests that DNA
methylation and histone H3K79 methylation patterns may be globally altered by 3Np53
expression. Because 2HG or succinate can competitively inhibit demethylase enzymes that
use α-ketoglutarate as a cofactor, elevated 2HG and succinate favors a general retention of
methyl marks on both histones and DNA (Xiao et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2011). DNA
methylation and histone H3K79 methylation are epigenetic regulators of transcription that
may enable even transient 3Np53 expression to “lock in” gene expression patterns that
propagate to cell progeny. Indeed, whereas both H3K79 methylation and DNA methylation
marks are reversible, DNA methylation also appears to be heritable (Bonasio et al., 2010).
Future studies will focus on whether ΔNp53:WTp53 alters patterns of DNA methylation
and/or H3K79 tri-methylation genome-wide, and how this might contribute to the geriatric
pathology of ΔNp53.
