Abstract
Epidemiologically related traits may share genetic risk factors, and pleiotropic analysis could identify individual loci
associated with these traits. Because of their shared epidemiological associations, we conducted pleiotropic analysis of
genome-wide association studies of lung cancer (12 160 lung cancer case patients and 16 838 control subjects) and cardiovascular disease risk factors (blood lipids from 188 577 subjects, type 2 diabetes from 148 821 subjects, body mass index from
123 865 subjects, and smoking phenotypes from 74 053 subjects). We found that 6p22.1 (rs6904596, ZNF184) was associated
with both lung cancer (P ¼ 5.50x10-6) and blood triglycerides (P ¼ 1.39x10-5). We replicated the association in 6097 lung cancer
case patients and 204 657 control subjects (P ¼ 2.40  10-4) and in 71 113 subjects with triglycerides data (P ¼ .01). rs6904596
reached genome-wide significance in lung cancer meta-analysis (odds ratio ¼ 1.15, 95% confidence interval ¼ 1.10 to 1.21,
Pcombined ¼ 5.20x10-9). The large sample size provided by the lipid GWAS data and the shared genetic risk factors between the
two traits contributed to the uncovering of a hitherto unidentified genetic locus for lung cancer.

Genetic heritability of lung cancer is estimated to be 14% (1), but
only a few genetic risk loci have been identified to date in
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of lung cancer in
Europeans (2). Epidemiological studies have shown associations
between lung cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors related to the metabolic syndrome (3,4). There is also substantial evidence that lipid metabolism and innate immunity
evolved from common pathways, and consequently genes that
influence lipid traits may also influence inflammation and subsequent cancer development (5–7). Lung cancer is also well
known to be strongly associated with tobacco smoking.
Predicated on the hypothesis that investigating shared genetic
risk factors across these traits could enhance the possibility of
identifying new genetic loci for lung cancer, we used quantilequantile (Q-Q) plots (8) (Supplementary Methods, available
online) to assess potential polygenic enrichment of singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with lung cancer
given association with each CVD risk factor or smoking phenotypes (Figure 1; Supplementary Figure 1, available online).
The analysis was based on the TRICL consortium
meta-analysis of lung cancer GWAS, including 12 160 lung cancer case patients and 16 838 control subjects (2)
(Supplementary Table 1, available online); the meta-analysis
data of blood lipids from the Global Lipids Genetics
Consortium (GLGC; including genetic association with

triglycerides [TG], and high and low density lipoproteinscholesterol [HDL-C and LDL-C]) from 188 577 subjects (9), of
type 2 diabetes (T2D) from 148 821 subjects (10), and of body
mass index (BMI) from 123 865 subjects (11); and the metaanalysis of cigarettes per day (CPD) and never vs ever smoking
(SMOKER) data from the Tobacco, Alcohol and Genetics (TAG)
consortium, including 74 053 subjects (Supplementary Table 2,
available online). The Supplementary Materials (available online) contain additional details on the contributing studies,
statistical analyses, and functional tests. All statistical tests
were two-sided unless otherwise specified. P values of less
than .05 were considered statistically significant.
The Q-Q plots show enrichment between lung cancer and
LDL-C and between lung cancer and TG blood lipid traits across
multiple P value thresholds, up to 10-5 (Figure 1, A and B), verified by an adaptive permutation procedure (Supplementary
Table 3, available online). In contrast, we observed no statistically significant enrichment (Bonferroni-corrected significance
threshold P < .0036) between lung cancer and HDL-C, BMI, T2D,
or smoking phenotypes (the analysis of smoking excluded the
SNP markers mapping to chr15:78,686,690-79,231,478, which are
known to be associated with lung cancer and smoking
(Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 1, available
online) (12–13). Thus, we excluded these traits from further
analysis.

sites. Similar findings are evident in adipocytes (ENCODE), extending the pleiotropic association between lung cancer and
lipid traits to their function in respective tissue types.
Additional functional analyses on relevant tissue types
would be important to study how the genetic risk variants assert their downstream effect on the traits of interest.
Our study emphasizes that pleiotropic analysis of GWAS
data of epidemiologically related traits can uncover hitherto
unidentified genetic associations. Moreover, some GWAS of
quantitative traits may be much larger than disease-specific
GWAS (like in the case of CVD risk factors vs lung cancer) and,
thus, may improve the likelihood to identify new loci for the
disease with the smaller sample size.

BRIEF
COMMUNICATION

Cross-phenotype-associated loci between lung cancer and
TG and between lung cancer and LDL-C were assessed by conjunction false discovery rate (FDR) (Supplementary Materials,
available online) (8). Because controlling FDR is heavily affected
by the number of identified SNPs, we pruned SNPs in linkage
disequilibrium (LD; r2 > 0.8) and excluded the major histocompatibility complex (MHC; genomic position (hg 19):
chr6:29,528,318-33,373,649 [14]), which harbors established lung
cancer susceptibility SNPs and is known for long-range LD. By
controlling conjunction FDR, we identified one genetic locus at
6p22.1, rs6904596 (A>G, minor allele frequency in caucasians ¼
0.094), associated with both lung cancer and blood triglycerides
(conjunction FDR ¼ 1.24E-02; P ¼ 5.50x10-6 for lung cancer; P ¼ 1.
39x10-5 for TG) (this locus and additional genetic loci shared between lung cancer and lipid traits are shown in Supplementary
Table 4 and Supplementary Figures 2-6, available online). This
locus remained statistically significant as defined by a conjunction FDR of less than .05, also using different thresholds for
pruning SNPs in LD (Supplementary Table 5, available online).
We tested this SNP for replication in 6097 lung cancer case
patients and 204 657 control subjects from deCODE, Harvard,
Holland, and Spain (Supplementary Table 6, available online).
This locus was replicated (Preplication ¼ 2.40  10-4) and attained
genome-wide significance for lung cancer risk in the metaanalysis of discovery and replication data (odds ratio ¼ 1.15,
95% confidence interval ¼ 1.10 to 1.21, two-sided Pcombined ¼ 5.
20x10-9, Pheterogeneity ¼ .91) (Table 1). This SNP was also replicated in the association with TG in 71 113 independent samples
from deCODE and Holland (two-sided P ¼ .01, Pcombined ¼ 1.34 x
10-6) (Table 1). The SNP association with lung cancer was mostly
driven by the squamous cell carcinoma subtype (P ¼ 2.80x10-5)
and not adenocarcinoma (P ¼ 0.06) (Supplementary Table 7,
available online).
rs6904596 localizes to 6p22.1 (27,491,299 bp; hg19) and lies 50
kb 5’ of zinc finger protein 184 (ZNF184). It shows expressionQTL in lung tissue (15) with HLA-DRB3 (b ¼ -6.79, P ¼ 1.10x10-11).
Additionally, rs7749305, located on chr6:27,446,566 (r2 ¼ 1 with
rs6904596 in HapMap 3 of Caucasian populations), shows suggestive regulatory functions. This SNP showed the strongest association with lung cancer but was not genotyped in the Global
Lipids Genetics Consortium GWAS. It lies within a DNaseI hypersensitive region in small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) and
A549 adenocarcinoma cells (ENCODE) and lies in a region hypomethylated in primary alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) from our
laboratory (Supplementary Figure 7, available online). rs7749305
alternate allele C appears to create ATF3 and HIF1A binding
