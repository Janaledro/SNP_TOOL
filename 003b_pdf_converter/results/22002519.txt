Abstract
Background—Activation of inflammatory pathways is one plausible mechanism underlying the
association between obesity and increased breast cancer risk. However, macrophage infiltration
and local biomarkers of inflammation in breast adipose tissue have seldom been studied in
association with obesity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Experiment Design—Gene expression profiles of normal breast tissue from reduction
mammoplasty patients. were evaluated by whole genome microarrays to identify patterns
associated with obesity status (normal-weight, body mass index (BMI) < 25; overweight, BMI
25-29.9; obese, BMI ≥ 30). The presence of macrophage-enriched inflammatory loci with
immunopositivity for CD68 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Results—After adjusting for confounding by age, 760 genes were differentially expressed (203
up and 557 down; FDR=0.026) between normal-weight and obese women. Gene ontology analysis
suggested significant enrichment for pathways involving IL-6, IL-8, CCR5 signaling in
macrophages and RXRα and PPARα activation, consistent with a pro-inflammatory state and
suggestive of macrophage infiltration. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) also demonstrated
that the genomic signatures of monocytes and macrophages were overrepresented in the obese
group with FDR of 0.08 and 0.13 respectively. Increased macrophage infiltration was confirmed
by IHC, which showed that the breast adipose tissue of obese women had higher average
macrophage counts (mean=8.96 vs 3.56 in normal-weight women) and inflammatory foci counts
(mean=4.91 vs 2.67 in normal-weight women).

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In past decades, the relationship between obesity and breast cancer risk has been extensively
studied. It has been established that obesity is strongly associated with a higher risk of
postmenopausal breast cancer with a 12% increase in risk per 5 kg/m2 increase in body mass
index (BMI) [1-3]. Recent research has suggested that obesity may also be associated with
premenopausal breast cancer [4]. In the largest study based on pooled data from 35,568
invasive breast cancer cases, Yang et al. found that obesity was associated with increased
risk of estrogen receptor negative/progesterone receptor negative (ER-/PR-) tumors with an
even stronger relation with triple-negative or basal-like tumors among younger women (≤ 50
years) [5]. Thus, while the relationships between obesity and breast cancer risk are complex,
there is growing evidence to support an etiologic role for obesity in multiple types of breast
cancer, both premenopause and postmenopause. These epidemiologic findings underscore
the importance of research on obesity-associated breast cancer risk and its underlying
biological mechanisms.
Obesity is characterized by expanded adipose tissue, which is traditionally considered as the
physiological site of energy storage. However, adipose tissue is also recognized as an
endocrine organ actively participating in numerous physiological processes [6, 7]. The
biological basis for obesity-associated breast cancer risk is not well established, though
several mechanisms have been postulated including dysregulated steroid hormone levels or
response, insulin resistance, insulin-like growth factor pathways, and adipokines [8-11]. It is
clear that obesity results in impaired adipose tissue function, ultimately, increasing
production and secretion of inflammatory molecules, like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1(MCP-1) [12, 13]. These
molecules have both local and systemic inflammation effects [1, 7].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While systemic effects have been a major focus of obesity-biomarker research, local effects
on breast cancer microenvironment are also important to consider. Locally, cancer-related
inflammation is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, increased levels of
inflammatory cytokines, and tissue remodeling, together mimicking biological processes
present during [14, 15]. Sustained local inflammation attenuates cell-mediated immunity and
increases angiogenesis, providing an ideal microenvironment for cancer development and
progression [16, 17]. Thus, the hypothesis that chronic local inflammation induced by
obesity may predispose individuals to breast cancer or may alter the progression of disease
is theoretically sound. However, the presence of inflammatory biomarkers and the presence
of specific inflammatory cell types in breast tissue has received limited investigation. Most
often, when breast tissue is studied, it is tissue of women with disease (invasive breast
cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or benign breast disease). To evaluate the hypothesis that
obesity increases local inflammation and creates an ideal microenvironment for cancer
promotion and progression, we evaluate gene expression profiles and performed
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of the normal breast tissue from reduction
mammoplasty patients. Our findings demonstrate that in women without disease, obesity is
associated with local changes in gene expression and cellular composition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Study subjects were women undergoing reduction mammoplasty at Baystate Medical Center
in Springfield, Massachusetts between 2007 and 2010. The Institutional Review Boards at
Baystate Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Amherst approved the study. All
participants consented to provide excess tissues not needed for diagnostic purposes. Tissues
were handled by snap freezing immediately after surgery and stored at −80°C. Specimens
were excluded if pathologic assessment of patient-matched, paraffin-embedded tissues
suggested any abnormal malignant or premalignant findings. Demographic and reproductive
information were collected by a telephone interview administered following surgery.
Patients in the current investigation include those with complete data on BMI, available
fresh frozen tissues to perform microarray, and paraffin blocks for IHC.
RNA isolation and microarrays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All microarrays were performed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Frozen
specimens were cut over dry ice and then homogenized (approximately 100mg whole tissue
specimen was homogenized for nucleic acid isolation). RNA was isolated following
standard manufacturer protocols using RNeasy kits. Higher RNA yields were obtained with
fatty, reduction mammoplasty tissues when using a Qiazol extraction step (Qiagen) prior to
purification on RNeasy column as described in Troester et al [18]. RNA quality and quantity
were analyzed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and a ND-1000 Nanodrop spectrophotometer
respectively before running two-color 4X44K Agilent whole genome arrays. Cy3-labeled
reference was produced from total RNA from Stratagene Universal Human Reference
(spiked with 1:1,000 with MCF-7 RNA and 1:1,000 with ME16C RNA to increase
expression of breast cancer genes) following amplification with Agilent low RNA input
amplification kit with minor modifications as described in Hu et al [19]. The identical
protocol was applied to total RNA from reduction mammoplasty specimens, with all patient
samples labeled with Cy5. Data were Lowess-normalized and probes that had a signal of
<10 dpi in either channel were excluded as missing, and probes that had more than 20%
missing data across all samples were excluded from further analysis. After mapping the
ENTREZ ID based on manufacture ID using Bioconductor libraries (hgug4112a.db:
hgug4112aENTREZID) [20, 21], we (a) eliminated the probes without corresponding
ENTREZ ID, (b) took the average of the duplicate probes, and (c) imputed missing data
using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) method with k=10. To focus on genes with variable
expression, we further excluded the probes with interquartile range (IQR) < median IQR.
After the above preprocessing, the number of the genes in the analysis was 8280. All data
are publicly available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE16113 and GSE
pending).
Gene expression data analysis
All of the following data analyses were performed using R (version 2.9.2). Obese status of
the study subjects was categorized into three groups based on BMI using current Center for
Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) definitions: obese was
defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, overweight was defined as 25 kg/m2 ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m2, and
normal-weight was defined as BMI< 25 kg/m2. No patients in this study had BMI less than
20 kg/m2. The distribution of the selected characteristics of the study subjects by obese
status was evaluated using Fisher’s exact test, with significant association defined using a
two-sided α of 0.05. Covariates that were associated with both obesity (p≤0.05) and
differential gene expression (false-discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05) were considered as potential
confounders and further included in the model selection. Considering the sample size, a
forward selection strategy and partial F-test were used to refine the model [22]. Potential

confounders were added into the model with gene expression level as the dependent variable
and obese status as the independent variable. The covariate was retained in the ANOVA
model if it was associated with differentially expressed genes in the presence of obesity.
FDR was used to control type I error due to multiple testing.
The biological function and network of the significant genes were assessed using Ingenuity
Systems Pathway analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity® Systems, www.ingenuity.com). To confirm
the pathways or functions suggested by IPA, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA version
3.5) was performed. The genomic profiles of human peripheral monocytes [23] and human
abdominal adipose tissue macrophages [24] were evaluated by GSEA, including all the
genes in each of these published lists that mapped to data from the reduction mammoplasty
specimens on 4X44K Agilent microarrays. Phenotype permutation (normal-weight vs obese)
and FDR were used to assess multiple testing [25] with FDR<0.25 considered statistically
significant [26].
Macrophage infiltration

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

IHC was used to evaluate macrophage infiltration. In brief, formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissues were sectioned at 7 micrometers and stained with antibody to CD68
(abcam, ab955, diluted 1:200) with diaminobenzidine. CD68 staining was revealed through
the use of a biotinylated secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch 115-065-166), ABC complex
(Standard Elite Vector Laboratories, PK6100) and reacted in diaminobenzidine (Invitrogen
DAB Substrate Kit 00-2014). CD68 positive cells were quantitated in adipose tissue, with
macrophage infiltration measured by the average count of CD68 positive cells in three
randomly-selected 10X fields per patient, and inflammatory foci measured as total number
per slide of aggregations of CD68 positive cells (CD68 positive cells ≥ 5).

RESULTS
Characteristics of the study population

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As is typical for women undergoing reduction mammoplasty, patients in our study tended to
be more obese than general U.S. population [27] with mean BMI of 30.1 kg/m2 [standard
deviation (SD)=5.9 and range of 22.2 kg/m2-48.2 kg/m2]. In this study, 22%, 38% and 40%
of the 74 women were normal-weight, overweight, and obese, respectively. Table 1 shows
the population characteristics according to obesity status. The women in the higher
categories of BMI were more likely to be older, postmenopausal, past oral contraceptive
users and past smokers (p≤0.05 in all instances). We did not observe significant difference
in race/ethnicity, parity, breastfeeding, and first-degree family history of breast cancer by
obesity status. Age, menopausal status, smoking, and oral contraceptive use were considered
as potential confounders of the obesity-gene expression association. However, further
analysis indicated that only age showed a significant effect (FDR≤0.05) on the gene
expression when obesity status was already in the model. Therefore the final ANOVA
model for obesity-associated gene expression included only age and obesity status.
Differentially expressed genes by obese status
Using the microarray data from 74 reduction mammoplasty samples with gene expression
levels as outcome/dependent variables, we performed ANOVAs to identify genes that were
differentially expressed by obesity status with normal-weight women as the reference
category. After controlling for age, a genomic profile of 760 genes that was differentially
expressed between obese group and normal-weight group (FDR<0.026) was identified, with
203 genes up-regulated and 557 down-regulated (Supplementary Table 1). Figure 1A
demonstrates that the 760-gene signature produced a distinct difference between normalweight and obese women using a one-way cluster of these genes with the 74 patients ordered

by BMI. Interestingly, this figure shows there was relative homogeneity within the
categories of BMI≥30 kg/m2 and BMI<25 kg/m2, but substantial heterogeneity existed
among those in the overweight group (25 kg/m2 ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m2). By two-way
hierarchical-clustering of the detected signature (Figure 1B), the study subjects were divided
into three clusters. One cluster was very small including 7 women who were similar to the
rest of the study population (including the distribution of obesity status) with the exception
of including more minorities (p=0.08). In the remaining two clusters, one was enriched for
normal-weight women (86% of normal-weight women were together in this cluster), and the
other was enriched for obese women (78% of obese women were in this cluster).
Overweight women were evenly distributed across the two clusters with about half in the
normal-weight-enriched cluster (44%) and about half in the obese-enriched cluster (56%).
Chi-square p-value for distribution of overweight among normal-weight or obese clusters
was 0.30. Thus both one-dimensional (genes only) and two-dimensional (genes and
samples) clusterings are suggestive of distinct BMI-associated gene expression effects
between normal-weight and obese groups and an intermediate phenotype in overweight
women. To evaluate whether there was a dose-response relationship between BMI and
expression of the obesity-associated gene expression profile, the 64 patients from the two
main clusters (normal-weight-enriched and obese-enriched clusters) were shown in Figure
1C according to BMI group (four groups: <25 kg/m2; 25-27.49 kg/m2; 27.5-29.99 kg/m2; ≥
30 kg/m2). The percentage of patients in obese-enriched cluster increased with
monotonically with BMI.
IPA was used to analyze for biological enrichment of specific pathways in the obesityassociated genomic signature detected by two-way ANOVA. As shown in Table 2, the upregulated genes in the 760-gene signature suggested association with endocrine system
disorders and metabolic diseases including diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome X,
nonalcoholic fatty liver, and dyslipidemia (Supplementary Table 2). Given the close
associations between these diseases/disorders with obesity, the findings preliminarily
indicated that changes in endocrine and metabolism induced by obesity may be reflected
locally in the breast tissues. Interestingly, the up-regulated genes were also related to
reproductive system diseases, particularly mammary carcinoma (Supplementary Table 2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The 760-gene signature also suggested enrichment for many canonical pathways. Among
them, IL-6 and IL-8 signaling, PPARα/RXRα activation, and CCR5 (CD195, a receptor for
RANTES and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)) signaling in macrophages were upregulated. All of these pathways have plausible links to infiltration and/or action of
macrophages, and considering the well-established association between obesity and
infiltration of macrophages in human abdominal adipose tissues [12, 13], we hypothesized
that breast tissue in obese women would show changes in cellular composition, especially
influx of macrophages.
Infiltration of macrophages
To evaluate the hypothesis that macrophages accumulate in the breast adipose tissues of
obese women, we first took advantages of our gene expression data and performed GSEA
analysis using published gene expression profiles of human peripheral monocytes [23] and
human abdominal adipose tissue macrophages [24] respectively (see Supplementary Table 3
for gene list). Compared to normal-weight women, the monocyte genomic profile signature
was enriched among obese women with a normalized enrichment score of 1.39 and FDR of
0.08. Likewise, the abdominal-adipose macrophage genomic profile was also enriched with
a normalized enrichment score of 1.42 and FDR of 0.13 (Supplementary Figure 1). These
analyses show that monocyte/macrophage-associated genomic signatures are
overrepresented in the adipose tissue of obese women relative to normal-weight women.

More direct evidence of changes in composition would come from imaging studies of the
human tissues. Thus, to confirm the presence of macrophages consistent with the gene
expression data, infiltration of macrophages in breast tissue comparing normal-weight and
obese women was assessed using IHC staining for CD68. The analysis included all obese
and normal-weight women from the microarray study for whom paraffin sections were
available, resulting in 41 women (18 normal-weight and 23 obese). The counts of
macrophages in adipose tissue were more than two-fold higher in obese women compared to
normal-weight women (8.96 per 10X field in obese women; 3.56 per 10X field in normalweight women. p-value=0.07). Comparing patients with macrophage count ≥5 per 10X field
to those with low infiltration (0-4 macrophages), we observed a substantial association
between obesity status and macrophage infiltration (OR=4.58; 95% CI (1.0379, 20.2401);
Fisher’s exact p-value=0.05) (Figure 2, representative normal tissue samples shown in
Supplement Figure 2). Similar associations were observed considering inflammatory foci in
breast adipose tissues. The average number of foci was 2.67 among normal-weight women
compared to 4.91 among obese women. The presence (vs absence) of inflammatory foci
showed a modest, but non-significant association with obesity status (OR=2.44; 95% CI
(0.69, 8.66); p-value=0.16).

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The human breast is a unique organ in that adipose tissue is a majority component,
comprising up to 56% of the total breast volume [28]. Therefore, adipose tissue plays a
critical role in regulating the microenvironment of breast tissue. However the dynamics of
the gene expression and cellular composition of breast tissue in response to various
exposures and stimuli are not well studied. Adipose tissue is not only a passive reservoir for
energy storage, but also a metabolic and endocrine organ, secreting numerous bioactive
substrates termed adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, as well as cytokines
which act on the local breast microenvironment and systemically [12, 29]. Adipose tissue
also harbors macrophages that maintain a balance in the production of pro- and antiinflammatory adipocytokines [30-32], which can be disrupted in obesity to create a chronic
low-grade inflammatory state [33]. While tissue studies in animals have shown that
inhibition of macrophage infiltration into obese adipose tissue can ameliorate the
dysregulation of adipocytokine production, and further ameliorate adipose tissue
inflammation and insulin resistance [34, 35], most evidence in humans regarding this
pathological process are based on the studies of abdominal/visceral adipose tissue [36]. In
the current study, we found evidence that this process may occur in nonmalignant breast
tissue.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Many of the processes identified in our gene expression profile are well established
pathological conditions known to increase with obesity, however, we also identified specific
pathways that are known to play an important role in breast microenvironment (e.g. IL-6)
and that have been previously been described as systemic effects of obesity [6, 36]. The
origin of the IL_6 signaling in our study may be from a variety of stromal sources, but
previous studies have suggested that in adipose tissue, non-adipose stroma are the most
likely contributors [36]. In our IHC analyses, macrophages are a likely contributor [37]. The
identification of other interleukin signaling pathways as co-expressed (CCR5, and PPARα)
also suggests a role for macrophages. The implications of this shift in the microenvironment
milieu are compelling, particularly given research emphasizing the importance of IL-6 and
IL-8 in maintaining a stem cell-like population in the breast [38]. Other pathways associated
with mammary stem/progenitor cells and mammary gland development [39-41], such as
such as Wnt/β-catenin and RANK signaling pathways were also implicated in the gene
expression patterns. In Ojalvo et al. [42] and in Lau et al. [43], these pathways are expressed
in differentiating tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), themselves, so tissue-level

imaging of pathway specific markers will be needed to identify the source of these signals in
normal breast tissue. Thus further research regarding how macrophages and premalignant/
malignant breast epithelium communicate in relation to breast cancer progression could
provide important mechanistic insight for obesity-associated breast cancer.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our sample size (n=74) was similar to that for other observational microarray-based studies
[44] and represents the largest reported study of reduction mammoplasty gene expression,
but we may have limited the power to detect the differences in certain gene expression levels
between BMI-defined groups. To offset concerns about the sample size, findings presented
here were strengthened by combining gene expression data with histological features and
more focused analyses of specific gene sets. Observations of inflammation and macrophage
infiltration (detected in gene-by-gene significance analysis and ontology/pathway analysis)
were supported by testing specific hypotheses based on the most relevant papers by using
pathway analysis using GSEA and by performing an immunohistochemical validation study.
The consistency of the results of various analyses using multiple techniques and approaches
strengthens our inference and decreases the emphasis on individual gene-based statistical
hypothesis tests. While the variance and small sample size for the histological analyses
resulted in p-values of p=0.05 and p=0.07, the association was strong and is supportive of
the statistically significant associations we observed by microarray. As per Poole [45],
selecting associations based on p-values is not a strong basis for scientific inference. Poole
notes that “results that deserve the greatest reliance are those that are most stable and
trustworthy.” The stability of our results are supported by technically independent but
biologically consistent results. Future work should evaluate inflammation markers in
independent test sets, preferably with large numbers of reduction mammoplasty patients.
Our analysis was out analytical approaches also represents a strength of this work. While
there are few established methods for addressing confounding in observational microarray
studies [46, 47], we used multivariable models to assess this important source of bias.
Interestingly, age emerged as an important variable determining the gene expression. Ageassociated effects on gene expression have been well recognized in animal tissues [48, 49];
but further study in human breast tissue merits investigation. We also examined interaction
(data not shown), and found limited evidence for effect modification by the factors we
examined. For example, the gene expression did not vary substantially by menopausal
status, hence preand post-menopausal women were grouped together. With larger sample
sizes, it may be possible to evaluate additional interactions between obesity and menopausal
status or reproductive history, which could help to elucidate which additional mechanisms
have dominance during different windows of susceptibility.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our study focused on reduction mammoplasty patients, which tend to have higher BMI than
the general population. Nevertheless, there were also women with quite low BMI in our
sample. In addition, the women in this study showed distributions of parity status and
menopausal status not dissimilar to these of the general population. Thus, while reduction
mammoplasty patients may not represent all women in the population (e.g. women with
BMI < 20 kg/m2 or with very small breasts), the data here are still biologically relevant for a
large subset of the general population. Furthermore, results presented here are consistent
with recent studies focused on mice and breast cancer patients [50, 51]. Subbaramaiah et al
[51] observed crown-like structures (CLS) (similar structure as inflammation foci), and
observed increased NF-kB binding activity and elevated aromatase expression and activity
in breast tissues of obese mice. Morris et al [50] showed that 75% of obese and 70% of
overweight breast cancer patients had CLS, while among normal-weight breast cancer
patients only 8.3% had CLS. This corresponds to an approximately 9-fold change in CLS
comparing obese patients to normal-weight patients. In our study of women without breast
cancer, we also observed a large fold-change in the proportion of patients with high

macrophage infiltration and inflammatory foci comparing obese and normal-weight women
(high macrophage infiltration more than four-fold and inflammatory foci more than two-fold
more prevalent in obese compared to normal-weight women). Thus the association we
observed confirms the trends reported previously for associations between obesity and
inflammatory foci/CLS. Whether inflammatory foci in turn confer greater risk of cancer
merits investigation in a larger study. However, based on our data and the previous
literature, the prevalence of macrophage foci in obese cancer patients (75%) is 1.25 times
that among obese non-diseased (60% among obese reduction mammoplasty patients), which
implies possible associations between macrophage infiltration and cancer outcome among
obese and overweight women. Importantly, our data show that macrophage infiltration in
adipose tissue precedes disease and is present in normal women with no pathological
findings.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While the role of macrophage infiltration in breast cancer etiology is not established, the role
of macrophage infiltration in breast cancer progression has been more widely studied. It is
believed that macrophage infiltration promotes of angiogenesis, matrix remodelling and
suppression of adaptive immunity [52]. The tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) express
several characteristics of M2-polarized macrophages [53], while obesity is believed to
induce a phenotypic switch in macrophages from an anti-inflammatory M2 polarized state to
a proinflammatory M1 state, with the M1 macrophages composing the “crown-like
structures” surrounding adipocytes [54, 55]. Thus, based on biological dynamics during
disease progression, a possible model for the role of macrophages in etiology is that chronic
inflammation caused by obesity (with microphage in M1 state) causes DNA damage, such
as oncogene activation or tumor-suppressor genes inactivation. Alternatively, the presence
of macrophage in the obese microenvironment from the earliest stages of tumor onset may
lead to promotion of very early cancers through specific signaling mechanisms, including
elevated expression of NF-κB and increased aromatase activity as recently reported [50].
Further studies should evaluate the specific M1 and M2 markers that may help delineate
more subtle population shifts among the mixed population of CD68 cells. A recent study
suggests that proliferation markers in combined with CD68 staining may also have
prognostic value [56]. Thus, a wide range of markers for macrophage dynamic and
inflammatory effects in normal tissue may provide new insight into the etiology and
progression of breast cancer. Each of these markers should be evaluated in light of the
heterogeneity of breast cancer, preferably by both menopausal status and by estrogen
receptor status. Further research on the tissue composition and gene expression behavior of
normal breast tissue in relation to breast cancer could identify important etiologic pathways
underlying the association between obesity and breast cancer.

Figure 1. Differential Gene Expression by Obesity Status

A genomic signature (760 genes) differentially expressed between normal breast tissue of
obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and normal-weight (BMI< 25 kg/m2) reduction mammoplasty
patients (FDR<0.026). (A) One-way (genes only) clustering of the identified signature (203
up and 557 down) with 74 patients ordered by BMI. (B) Two-way clustering (genes and
samples) of the identified signature. Three clusters were identified with one enriched for
obese patients (left), one enriched for normal-weight patients (middle). (C) The percentage
of patients in obese-enriched cluster based on two-way cluster analysis increased with BMI.
The number above each bar was the count of patient in each category.
