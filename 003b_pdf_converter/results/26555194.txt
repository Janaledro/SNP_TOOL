Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression, with documented roles in bone
metabolism and osteoporosis, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. Our aim was to identify miRNAs differentially
expressed in fractured vs nonfractured bones. Additionally, we performed a miRNA profiling of primary osteoblasts to
assess the origin of these differentially expressed miRNAs.
Methods: Total RNA was extracted from (a) fresh femoral neck trabecular bone from women undergoing hip
replacement due to either osteoporotic fracture (OP group, n = 6) or osteoarthritis in the absence of osteoporosis
(Control group, n = 6), matching the two groups by age and body mass index, and (b) primary osteoblasts obtained
from knee replacement due to osteoarthritis (n = 4). Samples were hybridized to a microRNA array containing more
than 1900 miRNAs. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots and heat map hierarchical clustering were performed. For
comparison of expression levels, the threshold was set at log fold change > 1.5 and a p-value < 0.05 (corrected for
multiple testing).
Results: Both PCA and heat map analyses showed that the samples clustered according to the presence or absence of
fracture. Overall, 790 and 315 different miRNAs were detected in fresh bone samples and in primary osteoblasts,
respectively, 293 of which were common to both groups. A subset of 82 miRNAs was differentially expressed (p < 0.05)
between osteoporotic and control osteoarthritic samples.
The eight miRNAs with the lowest p-values (and for which a validated miRNA qPCR assay was available) were assayed,
and two were confirmed: miR-320a and miR-483-5p. Both were over-expressed in the osteoporotic samples and
expressed in primary osteoblasts. miR-320a is known to target CTNNB1 and predicted to regulate RUNX2 and LEPR,
while miR-483-5p down-regulates IGF2. We observed a reduction trend for this target gene in the osteoporotic bone.
Conclusions: We identified two osteoblast miRNAs over-expressed in osteoporotic fractures, which opens novel
prospects for research and therapy.

Background
Increasing evidence indicates that epigenetic mechanisms
are fundamental to the regulation of gene expression.
Among them, microRNAs (miRNAs) are small (18–24 nt),
non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression
post-transcriptionally by binding to 3’-UTRs of target
mRNAs. Deregulation of any of the processes with which
miRNAs have been associated –including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis-could induce pathophysiological conditions, some of them severe, such as cancer [1].
In bone, miRNAs have been described as key factors
regulating bone formation, remodelling, and homeostasis
[2, 3]. Several studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in the control of bone cell differentiation and
function, as well as lineage commitment and cell progression of mesenchymal stem cells [4]. The understanding of miRNA regulation pathways and the identification
of miRNAs involved in skeletal function will be essential
to the development of miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for bone diseases. In the field of osteoporosis
pathophysiology, very few reports on defects in miRNAs
regulation mechanisms are available to date. Li et al. [5]
described a mutation in pre-miR-2861 that blocked expression of miR-2861 and caused primary osteoporosis
in two related adolescents. In another study, three polymorphisms in the 3’UTR of the FGF2 gene were genetically associated with bone mineral density (BMD) of the
femoral neck [6]. These genetic variants were located in
target sequences for miR-146a and miR-146b.
Very recently, Seeliger et al. [7] and Garmilla-Ezquerra
et al. [8] performed a microRNA analysis from total
bone tissue comparing osteoporotic vs non-osteoporotic
bone. Seeliger et al. [7] have identified 6 miRNAs upregulated in osteoporotic fracture patients: miR-21, miR23a, miR-24, miR-25, miR-100 and miR-125b meanwhile
Garmilla-Ezquerra et al. [8] detected miR-187 and miR518f as differentially expressed between sample groups.
Remarkably, both studies detected different miRNAs involved in the osteoporotic physiopathology.
One handicap in the study of miRNAs is their highly
variable expression, which depends on cell status (differentiation, proliferation) as well as environment (hormones,
cytokines, and other signalling factors). Indeed, profiling
miRNA expression in different cell sources of osteoblastic
lineage or under different treatments or pathological status results in a variety of bone-regulatory miRNA subsets
[9, 10]. Moreover, studies using cells from diverse mammalian species or established cell lines and different culture conditions can identify different miRNAs, making it
difficult to compare experiments and results and/or to extrapolate to in vivo physiological conditions.
The aim of this study was to identify miRNAs with altered expression in osteoporotic bone, using an experimental methodology that mimics the physiological conditions.

For this purpose, fresh trabecular bone samples from patients with osteoporosis and a recent fracture were compared to those of non-osteoporotic individuals. MicroRNA
array analysis was performed in total bone tissue to detect
all miRNAs expressed in these samples. Unlike the previous two mentioned reports [7, 8], extremely care was taken
in sample selection, resulting in homogenous anthropometric parameters such as age, body mass index (BMI) and
gender between groups. Moreover, patients with disorders
affecting bone remodelling were excluded from the study.
Furthermore, a complementary array was made from
human primary osteoblasts in order to assess which
miRNAs from the total bone array were expressed in
osteoblastic cells.

Methods
Ethics statement

The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Parc de Salut
MAR approved the present research. The approved protocols for obtaining fresh bone (and primary osteoblasts)
from hip or knee samples otherwise discarded at the
time of orthopaedic surgery were explained to potential
study participants, who provided written informed consent before being included in the study.
Bone samples and RNA extraction

In order to perform the microarray, fresh femoral neck
trabecular bone was obtained from 12 postmenopausal
women (discovery samples) undergoing hip replacement
due to either osteoporotic fracture (n = 6) or osteoarthritis
in the absence of osteoporosis (n = 6) (according to BMD
and T-score measurements [mean ± SD]: 0.794 ± 0.074
and −0.25 ± 0.827, respectively). For the replication stage,
a new set of samples were collected: 7 postmenopausal
women with osteoporotic fracture and 6 with osteoarthritis in the absence of osteoporosis (according to BMD
and T-score measurements [mean ± SD]: 0.882 ± 0.158
and - 0.342 ± 1.622, respectively). The osteoarthritic samples were considered the control group because the BMD
values classified them as non-osteoporotic. None of the
participants had a history of metabolic or endocrine disease, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, malignancy, Paget’s disease of bone, malabsorption syndrome,
hormone replacement therapy, anti-resorptive or anabolic
agents, oral corticosteroids, anti-epileptic drugs, or treatment with lithium, heparin, or warfarin.
Bony fragments were extracted from the transcervical
region of the femoral neck for both osteoporotic fracture
(OP) and control samples. Total fresh bone samples
were cut into small fragments, triple washed in phosphate buffered solution (PBS), and stored at −80 °C until
use. RNA extraction was performed at TATAA Biocenter
in Gothenburg, Sweden. A piece of tissue was cut out
and used in the extraction, following the manufacturer’s

De-Ugarte et al. BMC Medical Genomics (2015) 8:75

instructions for the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). QIAzol
Lysis Reagent was added to the samples and homogenized
for 5 min using the TissueLyser system. Chloroform was
added to each sample, followed by centrifugation for
15 min at 12000 g. The upper water phase was collected
and the extraction continued according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The concentration of the purified RNA was
analysed on a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc).
Human osteoblast culture

Human primary osteoblasts (hOB) were obtained from trabecular bone of postmenopausal women after knee replacement due to osteoarthritis (n = 4). Mean age (± SD)
was 71.50 ± 9.95 years and BMI was 30.44 ± 2.43. Bony tissue was cut into small pieces, washed in PBS to remove
non-adherent cells, and placed on a 140 mm culture plate.
Samples were incubated in Dulbecco Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM; Gibco; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), supplemented with sodium pyruvate (1 mM), L-glutamine
(1 mM), 1 % penicillin/streptomycin, 10 % foetal calf serum
(FCS), 0.4 % fungizone, and 1 % ascorbic acid. This allowed
osteoblastic cells to migrate from the fragments and proliferate. After approximately 3 weeks of culture and before
reaching confluence, total RNA was extracted using High
Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Alkaline
Phosphatase activity and osteocalcin gene expression was
assessed in order to confirm the osteoblastic phenotype
(data not shown).
microRNA array hybridization and data analysis

Microarray procedure and data analysis were conducted
at Exiqon Services, Denmark. The quality of the total
RNA was verified by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer profile
and 250 ng (total bone) or 750 ng (primary osteoblasts)
total RNA from both sample and reference was labelled
with Hy3™ and Hy5™ fluorescent dyes, respectively, using
the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Hi-Power Labeling Kit,
Hy3™/Hy5™ (Exiqon, Denmark) as indicated by the
manufacturer. The Hy3™-labelled samples and a Hy5™labelled reference RNA sample were mixed pair-wise
and hybridized to the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array
7th (Exiqon, Denmark), which contains capture probes
targeting all human, mouse, or rat microRNAs registered in the miRBASE 18.0. The miRCURY LNA™
microRNA Array Instruction manual and a Tecan
HS4800™ hybridization station (Tecan, Austria) were
used for this procedure. After hybridization, the microarray slides were scanned and stored in an ozone-free
environment (<2.0 ppb ozone) in order to prevent potential bleaching of the fluorescent dyes. The miRCURY
LNA™ microRNA Array slides were scanned using the
Agilent G2565BA Microarray Scanner System (Agilent

Page 3 of 11

Technologies, Inc., USA) and image analysis was carried
out with ImaGene® 9 (miRCURY LNA™ microRNA
Array Analysis Software, Exiqon, Denmark). The quantified signals were background-corrected (Normexp
with offset value 10, see Ritchie et al. 2007 [11]) and
normalized using the Lowess (LOcally WEighted
Scatterplot Smoothing) global regression algorithm.
Following normalization, both unsupervised and supervised data analysis was performed. Principal component
analysis (PCA) traditional and matrix plots and heatmap hierarchical clustering were obtained. For PCA
plots and the heat map, 50 mircoRNAs were used. They
were chosen in an unsupervised manner by taking the
normalized and background filtered data and sorting for
microRNA expressed above background in all samples
and with the largest standard deviation across the entire
sample set. For comparison of expression levels, calculated p-values were based on moderated t-statistics. The
threshold was set at log-fold change (log2) > 1.5 and a
p-value < 0.05 (corrected by Benjamini and Hochberg
[BH] multiple testing adjustment [12]).
Validation and replication of miRNAs by qPCR

MiRNA qPCR and further data analyses were conducted
at Exiqon Services, Denmark. Using the miRCURY
LNA™ Universal RT microRNA PCR, Polyadenylation
and cDNA synthesis kit (Exiqon), 10 ng RNA was
reverse-transcribed in 10 μl reactions. cDNA was diluted
100× and assayed in 10 μl PCR reactions according to
the protocol for miRCURY LNA™ Universal RT microRNA PCR; each microRNA was assayed once by qPCR
on the microRNA Ready-to-Use PCR, custom Pick&Mix
panel using ExiLENT SYBR® Green mastermix. Negative
controls excluding template from the reversetranscription reaction were performed and profiled in
the same way. Amplification was performed in a LightCycler® 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche) in 384-well
plates, and the amplification curves were analysed using
the Roche LC software, both for determination of Cp (by
the 2nd derivative method) and for melting curve
analysis.
The amplification efficiency was calculated using algorithms similar to the LinReg software. All assays were
inspected for distinct melting curves and the Tm was
checked to be within known specifications for the assay.
Furthermore, assays to be included in the analysis had to
be detected with 5 Cps less than the negative control
and Cp < 37. Data that did not meet all criteria were
omitted from any further analysis.
Normalization was based on the average of the references/normalizer assays detected in all samples. For the
present study, the miR-let-7e-5p was used as the
normalizer. Hence, the formula to calculate the normalized
Cp values is [average Cp(let-7e-5p) – assay Cp (sample)].

Data quality control, unsupervised data analysis, and
Student t-test with BH correction were performed
(corrected p-values < 0.05 were accepted as significant).
Bioinformatic analyses

Targets for differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted
using the following six programs: PicTar (http://pictar.mdcberlin.de), TargetScan Human (http://www.targetscan.org),
miRDB (http://mirdb.org), MiRanda (http://www.microrna.org), DIANA-TarBase (http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr), and miRTarBase (http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.
tw). The DIANA-mirPath web-based computational tool
[13] was used to identify molecular pathways potentially
altered by the intersection of miRNAs differentially
expressed in fractured bone.
Real-time PCR of osteoblastic markers and CD3

cDNA synthesis was performed using 500 ng of the
total extracted RNA from bone samples (OP:n = 5;
Control:n = 6). The product was diluted (1:1) with
RNAse-free pure water, and 2 μl was used to determine
gene expression of BGLAP (osteocalcin), ALPL (alkaline phosphatase), COL1A1, BMP2, IGF2 and CD3D
using qPCR (all reagents were obtained from Applied
Biosystems). The results were analysed using ExpressionSuite Software v.1.0.3 (Life Technologies), and the expression levels were calculated against 18S expression and then
normalized to an internal sample (relative quantification)
using arbitrary units. All qPCR reactions for each sample
were performed in triplicate. qPCR for 18S was carried out
under the same conditions using an 18S endogenous
control (Assay-on-Demand, Applied Biosystems). Gene
expression analysis from total RNA was performed twice.

Results
Sample description

The anthropometric features of the OP and Control
groups were shown in Table 1. Using the Mann–Whitney
U test, no statistical differences in these variables were observed between the two groups.

Unsupervised analysis of total bone miRNA array

Trabecular bone samples from patients with osteoporotic fracture were analysed individually in a miRNA
array and compared to samples from non-osteoporotic
bone. In total, 790 miRNAs were detected when all samples were included. As a first step, an unsupervised analysis of array results based on the expression profile was
performed in order to identify variation patterns related
to biological or technical factors. A PCA using the 50
miRNAs with the largest variation across all samples
was performed to get an overview of how the samples
clustered, based on their variance (Fig. 1a). Clustering of
non-osteoporotic samples (control group) suggested a
homogenous miRNA-expression profile. On the other
hand, a visual cluster did not exist in the OP group samples, although they separated from controls according to
PC1 (x-axis). Sample O-500, obtained from an OP
patient, neither clustered with the other osteoporotic
samples nor with the control group, although it behaved
as a control according to PC1. This sample was considered an outlier. The heat map diagram, with a clear clustering of control samples and more disperse clustering
of osteoporotic samples, corroborates the PCA results
(Fig. 1b).
Comparison of total bone microRNA expression between
OP cases and controls

Mean miRNA expression levels were compared between
the OP and control groups, excluding sample O-500.
This analysis identified a subset of 82 miRNAs (out of
the 1932 miRNAs analysed) whose absolute value of logfold change was larger than 1.5 and adjusted p-value was
below 0.05 (Additional file 1: Table S1). Seven of these
miRNAs corresponded to SNORDs and three to viruses;
all of these were excluded from the validation step.
Eight hsa-miRNAs underwent validation in the discovery samples by qPCR (miR-675-5p, miR-30c-1-3p,
miR-483-5p, miR-542-5p, miR-142-3p, miR-223-3p,
miR-32-3p, and miR-320a) according to the following
criteria: available Exiqon probes, the best hits in bone
array (signal intensity and significant differences between
the groups), and predicted to target genes involved in

Fig. 1 a PCA plot and (b) heat map diagram. Principal component analysis and clustering was performed on all samples and on the top 50 microRNAs
with the highest standard deviation. Normalized log ratio values were used for the analysis. a Before the analysis, the features were shifted to be zero
centered and scaled to unit variance. b Diagram shows the result of a two-way hierarchical clustering of microRNAs and samples. The clustering is done
using the complete-linkage method together with the Euclidean distance. Each row represents a microRNA and each column, a sample. The microRNA
clustering tree is shown on the left. The colour scale illustrates the relative level of microRNA expression: red, below the reference channel; green, higher
than the reference

bone metabolism. The PCA plot of individual qPCR
results showed a sample clustering similar to the
array results, corroborating the different biological
sources of the two sample groups (Fig. 2). Again,
sample O-500 could not be clustered with either biological group.
In order to exclude the presence of different amount
of hematopoietic cells among bone samples, especially
between osteoporotic and control group, the expression
of CD3 marker was analysed by qPCR. No significant
differences were detected among samples neither between biological groups (Additional file 2: Figure S1).
Moreover, this expression was very low compared to
CD3 + human T-cells which were FACS sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from buffy
coats (data not shown). Hence, differences observed
among samples are not due to the blood cells present
within bone fragments.
After validation, three miRNAs –miR-30c-1-3p, miR320a, and miR-483-5p– showed significant differences
between the OP and control groups (Table 2). However,
only miR-320a and miR-483-5p withstood BH multipletesting correction (Fig. 3).
The replication samples were added in the analysis in
order to increase the sample size. The miR-320a (p =
0.005) and miR-483-5p (p = 0.036) still showed significant differences between biological groups.

Expression of IGF2 in total bone mRNA from OP cases
and controls

Since miRNA miR-483-5p is located within intron 2 of
IGF2, the expression of this gene was assessed by qPCR
to assess its co-expression with miR-483-5p. In the OP
samples, IGF2 was under-expressed compared to control
samples (Fig. 4). Thus, IGF2 did not show the overexpression found for miR-483-5p in the OP group,
instead showing a trend in the opposite direction.
BMP2, COL1A1, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin
gene expression were also evaluated in OP and control
samples as disease reference markers. All four showed
diminished levels in the osteoporotic bone, as expected
(Fig. 4). Although a trend is clearly detected in all genes
tested, the limited sample size and experiment replication did not allow sufficient power to reach statistical
differences between the biological groups.
MicroRNA array profiling of cultured primary osteoblasts

To determine which of the total bone miRNAs were
expressed in osteoblasts, miRNA profiling of four hOB
samples in passage 0 was performed. A total of 315 miRNAs were detected in osteoblasts, of which 293 (93 %)
were also detected in total bone samples (Fig. 5). These
293 osteoblastic miRNAs represent a 37 % of all 790
bone miRNAs. Regarding the 82 miRNAs differentially
expressed between control and OP samples, 46 were also

De-Ugarte et al. BMC Medical Genomics (2015) 8:75

Fig. 2 Principal component analysis was performed on all samples. Normalized (dCp) values were used for the analysis. Bone samples from the
miRNA array were used for the validation stage (OP:n = 6; Control:n = 6). Samples are clustered based on their biological group; however, sample
O-500 appears to be an outlier

detected in the osteoblast array, including miR-320a and
miR-483-5p. Interestingly, 22 miRNAs found in the hOB
array were not detected in total bone.
Target prediction and pathway analysis for differentially
expressed miRNAs

two differentially expressed miRNAs identified. Targets

predicted and validated for miR-320a are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation (SRF,
ARPP-19, PDGFD) and apoptosis inhibition (MCL1),
signal transduction (MAPK1, SGK, DNER, JAK2), gene
expression regulation (PPARGC1A, SP1, CAMTA1,
ESRRG), growth factors (IGF1, BMP3 and 6), and hormone, growth factor, and cytokine receptors (LEPR,
NR3C1, BMPR1A, RARG, RXRA, IGF1R, IL6R,
PTGER3, TFR1). This miRNA is involved in 45 KEGG
pathways according to DIANA-mirPath predictions, the
most significant being prostate cancer (6.436856e-14),
endometrial cancer (4.517902e-10), mTOR signalling
pathway (1.336018e-07), and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway (2.347282e-07).
Cell proliferation factors such as SRF and MAPK3 (mirTArBase) are validated targets for the less-studied miR483-5p. KEGG pathways involving miR-483-5p target genes
are mainly ECM-receptor interaction (0.00114789) and NGlycan biosynthesis (5.118433e-07), as well as PI3K-Akt
signalling (0.01153999) and focal adhesion (0.002081914)
(DIANA-mirPath).
The intersection pathways involving genes targeted by
miR-320a and miR-483-5p are mainly prostate cancer
(4.496403e-14), PI3K-Akt signalling (5.614388e-08), and
focal adhesion (6.000918e-07). Genes belonging to the
mentioned pathways which are targeted by these two
miRNAs are shown in Fig. 6.

Discussion
The present study is focused on the identification of
miRNAs with altered expression in osteoporotic bone.
Fresh trabecular bone was collected from patients with
and without osteoporotic fracture with homogenous anthropometric parameters such as age, BMI, gender or

was used as endogenous control. Results are expressed as mean
and standard error

disorders affecting bone remodelling. These accurate selection criteria of samples allowed us to identify, unlike
previous studies, miRNAs altered due to osteoporotic
fracture specifically. The results obtained can help to
identify putative targets for new therapeutic approaches.
The unsupervised analysis of the miRNA profiling
from total bone samples showed that osteoporotic bone
clearly differed from control samples, which were able to
generate a biological cluster. In contrast, osteoporotic
samples presented a much more scattered distribution.

It is tempting to speculate that the pathophysiology of
the osteoporotic disease and ultimately the bone fracture
has a heterogeneous aetiology illustrated by different
miRNA expression patterns. Working with human samples of fresh bone directly obtained from fractured sites
generates higher variability than working with cell lines
or isogeneic animal models, but provides a scenario
closer to the pathophysiological situation. Hence, our
study is based on human bone samples obtained with
minimal laboratory manipulation.
In the analysis of differential expression between
osteoporotic and control samples, 82 miRNAs reached
significance, and after qPCR validation, two miRNAs
were significantly over-expressed in osteoporotic samples (miR-320a and miR-483-5p). Both miRNAs were
found in the hOB array, suggesting a possible alteration
in the osteoblastic cell function. However, since these
miRNAs are known to be expressed in a wide variety of
cell types, we cannot rule out their expression in other
bone cells, and hence a wider spectrum of bone cellular
dysfunction. Another miRNA, miR-30c-1-3p, was also
over-expressed in osteoporotic samples, although this
did not withstand multiple-testing correction. miR-30c1-3p was not detected in the hOB array. This may suggest a hematopoietic origin for this miRNA since it was
reported in macrophages [14] and NK cells [15].
According to our results, 37 % of total bone miRNAs
are expressed in bone-forming cells. There are 22 miRNAs detected in the hOB array that were not found in
total bone. It may be that hOB cultures, grown in a
homogenous and controlled environment, allow for the
detection of low-expressed osteoblast-specific miRNAs,
which would be diluted in total trabecular bone.

Alternatively, in vitro conditions of cultured cells may
create an artificial environment leading to an altered
miRNA expression.
miR-320a, which is conserved in human, mouse, rat,
and cow, is encoded within the basal promoter of the
cell-cycle gene POLR3D in the anti-sense orientation.
Interestingly, this miRNA targets the POLR3D promoter
in cis with perfect complementarity, leading to its direct
transcriptional silencing [16]. miR-320a has been extensively studied, both in cancer and in osteoblastic cell
function. Some reports indicate that this miRNA may
regulate the osteoblast differentiation [17] by targeting
key bone-formation genes such as CTNNB1 (B-catenin)
[18] and RUNX2 [19]. In this context, Hamam et al. [20]
observed that miR-320 family (miR-320a, 320b, 320c,
320d and 320e) were upregulated during adipogenesis
suggesting the miR-320 family as possible molecular
switch promoting adipocytic differentiation of hMSC by
targeting RUNX2, MIB1, PAX6, YWHAH and ZWILCH.
miR-483-5p has been associated with several pathological conditions, including tumours such as adrenocortical and ovarian serous carcinoma [21, 22], cartilageassociated pathologies such as multiple osteochondroma
[23] and osteoarthritic chondrocytes [24]. This miRNA
has also been detected in human osteosarcoma cells
[25]. MiR-483 is encoded within the second intron of
the IGF2 gene. The pre-miRNA generates two mature
miRNAs, miR-483-5p and miR-483-3p, both of them
present in the bone and hOB profiles of this study,
although only miR-483-5p showed significant differences
between the control and OP groups. Liu et al. [26] demonstrated that miR-483-5p binds to the 5’-UTR of the
major foetal IGF2 promoter transcript, enhancing the

De-Ugarte et al. BMC Medical Genomics (2015) 8:75

association of the RNA helicase DHX9 to the IGF2
mRNA and leading to its up-regulation. However, miR483-5p does not act on promoters that drive adult IGF2
expression. In mouse Hepa1-6 cells, Ma et al. [27] determined that miR-483-5p is transcriptionally co-expressed
with its host gene, Igf2, and negatively regulates it. The
same pattern of regulation was observed in cartilage
samples from old mice and murine osteoarthritic cartilage, in which there were higher levels of miR-483
(orthologous to hsa-miR-483-5p) and lower mRNA
levels of Igf2 [28]. In agreement with these data from the
murine system, when we tested IGF2 mRNA levels in
the osteoporotic bone samples, in which miR-483-5p
was up-regulated, we observed a trend of reduction relative to controls (see Fig. 4). To our knowledge, this is
the first time in which this miRNA that down-regulates
IGF2 is found over-expressed in osteoporotic bone.
Osteoblasts synthesize IGF-I and IGF-II, which have
mitogenic effects on bone cells and also promote collagen production and matrix apposition [29]. We tested
osteoblastic markers in our samples of total fresh bone
in order to compare the osteoblastic function between
biological groups. Visibly, the gene expression results
showed a diminished expression of all tested markers
(BMP2, COL1A1, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin),
corroborating the abnormal functionality of osteoporotic
bone samples used in this study. However, the limited
sample size does not allow sufficient statistical power to
determine significant differences between groups in
these qPCR results.
When the intersection of the pathways targeted by
miR-320a and miR-483-5p were explored, prostate cancer, PI3K-Akt signalling, and focal adhesion emerged as
the most significant. These three pathways share many
genes: SOS2, IGF1R, PDK1, PDGFD, PIK3CA, AKT3,
PTEN, and MAPK1. Most of them belong to cell proliferation and survival signalling, suggesting a dysfunction
in the osteoblastic cell renewal in the osteoporotic bone.
Regarding miR-30c-1-3p (miR-30c-1*), it is an intronic
miRNA encoded within the NFYC (nuclear transcription
factor Y, gamma) gene. Although it did not withstand
multiple-testing correction, it is worth noting that the
analysis of targeted genes for this miRNA showed that
Wnt signalling is the most significantly affected pathway,
containing up to eight targeted genes. The key role of
this pathway in bone remodelling is well known [30].
Very recently, Seeliger et al. [7] and Garmilla-Ezquerra
et al. [8] performed a microRNA analyses from total
bone tissue comparing osteoporotic vs non-osteoporotic
bone, resulting in different miRNA expression pattern
compared to our findings. Remarkably, these two previous studies have several features that can explain these
discrepancies. Among them are the diverse experimental
approaches, arrays, and sample sizes used. Moreover,

Page 9 of 11

these previous studies compared patients with nonhomogeneous anthropometric or clinical characteristics, such as age, sex, BMI, and endocrinology disorders
(diabetes mellitus), which are essential for the regulation of bone metabolism. Therefore, it might be that
their findings had been interfered by these external
conditions while we stressed on the absence of concomitant diseases or external factors that potentially
could induce noise.
An important strength of our study is the extremely
careful control of potentially confounding characteristics
between cases and controls in terms of age, sex, BMI
and metabolic diseases highly prevalent in this population as diabetes. These strict inclusion criteria explain
the relatively small sample size in our study, compared
to other similar works where samples are from patients
with more heterogeneous characteristics. Therefore, the
miRNAs detected in our study can be more reliably considered involved in the osteoporotic phenotype. On the
other hand, a possible limitation of our approach is that
the non-fractured patients used as controls were osteoarthritic and other bone abnormalities may be occurring
in this group. Due to obvious ethical reasons the collection of fresh bone from joint samples of healthy individuals is not allowed. However, in an attempt to minimize
this potential caveat, we were careful in obtaining the
bone samples from a location distant from the interface
between bone and cartilage and, therefore, as far away as
possible from the osteoarthritic lesion.
At this stage of miRNA discovery, results from our
study and others offer an important breakthrough for
the understanding of miRNA biology and pathology in
bone. While serum analysis could be interesting to find
biomarkers, extensive analyses of osteoporosis-related
miRNAs in bone tissue is required to better understand
the role of miRNAs in the disease and to explore the potential to design local therapeutic approaches.

Conclusions
We have identified two miRNAs over-expressed in bone
samples from patients with osteoporosis and fracture
compared to patients with osteoarthritis in the absence
of osteoporosis. The expression of both miRNAs has
been detected in osteoblasts. Both are putative regulators
of key genes required for bone metabolism. Whether
these altered miRNAs are a cause or a consequence of
the disease remains to be elucidated. Nonetheless, they
might offer promising potential as therapeutic targets in
osteoporosis.
