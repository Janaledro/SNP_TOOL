Although most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
occur in smokers, only a fraction of smokers develop the disease. We
hypothesized distinct molecular signatures for COPD and emphysema
in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of current and
former smokers. To test this hypothesis, we identified and validated
PBMC gene expression profiles in smokers with and without COPD. We
generated expression data on 136 subjects from the COPDGene study,
using Affymetrix U133 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
Multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates (gender, age,
body mass index, family history, smoking status, and pack-years) was
used to identify candidate genes, and ingenuity pathway analysis was
used to identify candidate pathways. Candidate genes were validated
in 149 subjects according to multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, which included 75 subjects not previously profiled.
Pathways that were differentially expressed in subjects with COPD and
emphysema included those that play a role in the immune system,
inflammatory responses, and sphingolipid (ceramide) metabolism.
Twenty-six of the 46 candidate genes (e.g., FOXP1, TCF7, and ASAH1)
were validated in the independent cohort. Plasma metabolomics was
used to identify a novel glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of emphysema, supporting the genomic association between
acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and emphysema. COPD is a systemic disease
whose gene expression signatures in PBMCs could serve as novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema are lung diseases with systemic manifestations in
blood. We identify peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene
expression profiles for both COPD and emphysema, and
replicate some of the top candidates in subjects from the
COPDGene cohort. Pathways associated with COPD and
emphysema include cell signaling, transcription factors, and
sphingolipid metabolism. These genes and pathways could
serve as both diagnostic tests and therapeutic targets.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results from
a combination of environmental exposures and genetic susceptibility, and is the third leading cause of death in the United
States (1). Although cigarette smoking is the major environmental
risk factor and is present in greater than 80% of patients with
COPD (2), only approximately 20% of smokers develop COPD.
Previous studies have shown that there are heritable risk factors
(3, 4), but the relationship between genetic risk and the molecular
changes associated with COPD remains unknown. Although the
traditional definition of COPD is based on spirometry measurements, recent work suggests that distinct COPD subtypes are
independent of spirometry, such as those with emphysema
predominance (5), chronic bronchitis (6), or frequent exacerbations (7). The molecular mechanisms for these phenotypes
remain largely unknown, but several studies using small panels
of selected biomarkers suggest that inflammation plays a role
in distinguishing phenotypes (8, 9).
Although the primary site of disease in COPD is the lung, increasing evidence indicates that COPD is a systemic disease with
such manifestations as inflammation, weight loss, and skeletal
muscle dysfunction (10, 11). Several systemic biomarkers (e.g.,
serum amyloid A and procalcitonin) have been associated with
exacerbations of COPD (12). Furthermore, biomarkers in plasma,
sputum, and exhaled breath are also associated with fat-free
mass in subjects with mild COPD (13). Because of its systemic
nature, we hypothesized that genome-wide expression profiling of
peripheral blood may be used to identify signatures of COPD
phenotypes.
Genome-wide expression studies in subjects with COPD and
emphysema have been performed in lung tissue, but typically
have involved small sample sizes (n ¼ 16–75) because of the
invasiveness of sample collection (14–18). As an alternative, we
propose the use of peripheral blood to study gene expression
profiles in smokers with and without COPD because of its noninvasive availability and ease of use for biomarker screening.
The utility of peripheral blood gene expression profiling for the
identification of molecular signatures has been demonstrated in
a wide range of diseases and disorders, including cancers and
neurologic disease (19). Furthermore, studies of COPD have

Bahr, Hughes, Armstrong, et al.: Gene Expression Signatures in COPD

found overlapping gene expression signatures between blood and
lung tissue (20) or alveolar macrophages (21). However, those
recent COPD studies of blood involved small sample sizes (n ¼
24–38) (20, 21) and therefore low statistical power to observe real
differences, or they primarily examined subjects with less severe
COPD (22). To overcome these limitations, we describe an
investigation, which to our knowledge is the largest to use
gene expression profiling (n ¼ 211) in blood, with a comprehensive representation of COPD severity.

was performed using Qiagen RNeasy RNA isolation spin-column kits
and protocol, combined with the fully automated Qiagen QIAcube (both
from Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review
Board at National Jewish Health. All subject participants provided written, informed consent and were part of the COPDGene cohort of current and former smokers aged 45–80 years, with a history of smoking at
least 10 pack-years, and who self-identified as either non-Hispanic
white or African-American, and who had not experienced an acute
exacerbation of COPD for at least 30 days (23). Subjects were initially
divided into either a hypothesis (n ¼ 136) or a replication/testing (n ¼
75) group. The hypothesis group was designed to represent a COPD
cohort with a broad range of airflow obstruction, and was balanced
with respect to demographic and clinical covariates (Table 1). To validate our top findings using an independent platform (as will be discussed), 74 subjects in the hypothesis group were randomly selected as
a confirmation group, in addition to the 75 independent replication
subjects (see Figure E1 and Table E1 in the online supplement).

Clinical Variables
COPD is defined as post–bronchodilator airflow obstruction with a ratio
of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced expiratory
volume (FVC) of less than 0.70, and is further subdivided into Stages
1–4, based on Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) guidelines (24). Subjects with FEV1/FVC greater than or
equal to 70 and FEV1 percentage of less than 80% post–bronchodilator
were considered GOLD unclassified (25). Secondary endpoints included percent emphysema, gas trapping, and 6-minute walking distance (please see the online supplement for further details) (23).

Microarray Experiment and Analysis
The expression of 54,675 transcripts was measured using Affymetrix
Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Gene Array (GEO accession number
GSE 42057; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Quality control was performed, and data were filtered and normalized (see the online supplement). For each probe set, a linear model was fit for the association
between gene expression and lung function while controlling for age,
sex, body mass index, parental history of COPD, and two smoking variables (smoking status and pack-years). Afterward, the statistical significance of the slope for expression was tested and controlled at a 0.05
false-discovery rate (FDR) (26).

Pathway Analysis
Genes whose expression levels were associated with lung function were
further investigated using IPA (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA).
The overrepresentation of significant genes within pathways was
assessed using Fisher’s exact test, and the FDR was controlled at 0.10.

High-Throughput Quantitative RT-PCR
Based upon preliminary results, 46 genes of interest were selected for
validation, using the Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Open Array
Platform (see the online supplement). Expression was determined as
fold change compared with a panel of five control genes. The Spearman
correlation coefficient was calculated for primary clinical endpoints, and
P values were controlled at an FDR of 0.05. Combined P value calculations between platforms were performed using the Stouffer combined
P value test in both directions (up-regulated or down-regulated) (27).

RESULTS
The demographics of subjects used for microarray analysis are
listed by GOLD stage in Table 1. Attempts were made to balance subjects by age, sex, and pack–years for different GOLD
stages, and to include a spectrum of emphysema severity. Clinical phenotypes were associated with GOLD stage, pack-years
of smoking, and current smoking status.

PBMC and RNA Isolation
Peripheral blood was drawn into a BD Vacutainer Cell Preparation
Tube (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), which was processed
within 60 minutes according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Upon
centrifugation, lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells appeared in
a distinct band and were isolated from the supernatant. RNA isolation

Microarray Studies of PBMCs

After microarray data normalization and filtering (see the online
supplement), separate linear models for the remaining 12,531
transcripts were fit for post-bronchodilator FEV1 percentage and

FEV1/FVC across the 136 subjects. The total number of transcripts
whose relative abundance was associated with FEV1 percentage,
while controlling for demographic and smoking covariates, was
1,090. The total number of transcripts whose relative abundance
was associated with FEV1/FVC while controlling for covariates
was 1,745. Their intersection involved 993 transcripts (Table E2).
For the most statistically significant genes, gene expression
explained almost 20% of the variation in FEV1 percentage
(Figure E2). With covariates, the entire clinical and gene expression model explained about 25% of the variation in FEV1
percentage.
A preliminary investigation revealed that 830 genes of the 993
statistically significant transcripts mapped to 266 canonical pathways (Table E3). Thirty of these had more statistically significant
genes represented than would be expected by chance. A large
fraction of those (15 out of 30) were related to immunity and

inflammatory responses (e.g., Calcium-Induced T Lymphocyte
Apoptosis, T Cell Receptor Signaling, Role of Macrophages,
Fibroblasts and Endothelial Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis).
An example in Figure 1 shows the role of the nuclear factor
of activated T cells (NFAT) in the regulation of the immune
response pathway, where the transcription factor NFAT is upregulated in subjects with more severe COPD. Metabolic pathways were also overrepresented in our list (e.g., sphingolipid
metabolism) (28).
Confirmation and Replication of Gene Expression Findings

A quantitative RT-PCR strategy was used for the confirmation
and replication of PBMC gene expression in 46 selected genes
(Table E4). Candidate genes were selected from preliminary
microarray results, based on their overall significance according

to P value (10), and their occurrence in significant pathways
related to the immune system (11), sphingolipid metabolism
and signaling (17), or multiple significant pathways (8). Confirmation involved 74 random subjects profiled in the microarray study
(Figure E1). Another 75 independent subjects were not used in
the microarray experiments, but were used for the “replication”
(or testing) cohort (Table E1).
Twenty-six of the 46 genes profiled showed significant correlation between expression and FEV1/FVC over the complete
cohort (FDR-adjusted P , 0.05; see Table E4 in the online data
supplement; significant results for FEV1 percentage involve
a subset of results for FEV1/FVC, and therefore FEV1/FVC is
reported). The magnitude of adjusted P values and the direction
of effects (correlation) were similar between the confirmation
and replication cohorts. For the 46 genes, the effects of smoking
on expression were examined in the larger microarray study, and
current smoking status was not predictive of gene expression for
any individual probe set on the microarray. However, pack-years
were significant for one probe set in the PLCL2 gene (Table E5).
For the final selection of genes, we examined the most significant discovered, based on results from both platforms, namely, the
microarray (n ¼ 136) and quantitative RT-PCR (n ¼ 75, i.e., the
replication cohort not contained in the original microarray study).
Table 2 lists the top 16 candidates for both panels (FDR , 0.05).

on disease severity, namely, if there was a positive correlation
with emphysema and gas trapping, there was a negative correlation with distance walked, FEV1 percentage, and FEV1/FVC,
and vice versa. Eight genes produced significant correlations for
primary and secondary phenotypes (Figure 2).

Association of PBMC Gene Expression with Secondary
Clinical Phenotypes

Many of the 16 candidate genes associated with airflow obstruction were also associated with secondary clinical phenotypes
(FDR , 0.05). Twelve were correlated with emphysema, 13
were correlated with gas trapping, and eight were correlated
with distance walked (Table E6). None of these candidate genes
were associated with chronic bronchitis. Correlations were consistent with the microarray results (Table E7) and were based

Classification Using Random Forests

To assess the predictive power of the top candidate genes to predict disease status, the supervised learning algorithm “random
forests” was used to construct a classifier from the top candidate
genes in Table 2. The estimated error rate was approximately
14%, based on the expression of probe sets for these genes,
using the microarray data on the original subjects. A similar
analysis was performed on the quantitative RT-PCR data using
the replication subjects (those not in the microarray analysis),
and the estimated error rate was 10%.
Meta-Analysis

Although no other studies this large have investigated PBMC
gene expression in COPD, a recent study reported on wholeblood microarray gene expression experiments, using the Sentrix
Human WG-6 BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) microarray
platform in 67 test subjects with 69 confirmation subjects (GOLD
Stages 1 and 2) (22). A meta-analysis with our results identified
a significant overlap of 61 genes (P ¼ 3.1 3 10210; see the online
supplement).
To explore the specificity of our findings in COPD, we examined three other PBMC expression studies in chronic inflammatory diseases unrelated to the lung (Crohn disease and ulcerative
colitis) or acute inflammatory disease in the lung (severe acute
respiratory syndrome). As with our study, probe sets were filtered if they were not present, and similarity was evident in
the number of probe sets filtered in our results compared with
each of the three studies (P , 1023). Comparing retained probe
sets, no significant overlap was found with our gene list and the
differentially expressed genes between disease and control subjects in any of the three studies (P . 0.20). This indicates that
the identified PBMC expression profiles have some specificity to
COPD, and are not solely attributable to a general disease state.
Metabolite Profiling

Metabolomics was also used to identify differences in smallmolecule profiles among these patients (see the online supplement). Metabolomic investigations identified 19 differentially
expressed metabolites between control subjects and those with
COPD. A search of the Metlin database resulted in six matches
within an acceptable mass tolerance (,5 ppm). One of these,
lactosylceramide, also known as galabiosylceramide, was confirmed using high-performance liquid chromatography time of
flight (Figure E3). Lactosylceramide was present in all patients
with emphysema, a few of the smoking control subjects, and
none of the patients with COPD but no emphysema (P ¼
1.93 3 10211).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is one of the largest studies of microarray
gene expression profiling for COPD in humans. Unlike most
PBMC microarray publications, we were able to confirm many
of our most significant findings, using a large independent cohort
of subjects. A few of these candidate genes were reported to be
associated in smaller previously published studies of PBMC gene
expression in similar cohorts, lending weight to the importance
of the expression of these genes as biomarkers for COPD. In

addition to the large size of both the discovery and testing cohorts,
our study contained additional unique features, including a highly
phenotyped study population with quantitative computed tomography scans, a balanced study design among GOLD groups, and
companion metabolomic investigations.
Most previous studies of gene expression in subjects with
COPD have used either lung tissue (15, 17) or bronchial epithelia
(16). Because previous studies suggested that COPD is a systemic
disease (11, 12, 29, 30), we postulated that the presence of a

systemic gene expression profile in subjects with COPD. The
choice of studying gene expression in PBMCs versus lungspecific cells such as airway epithelium was primarily determined
by the accessibility of suitable samples and the appropriateness of
blood draw versus bronchoscopy as a clinical assay. Microarrays
of PBMCs have been used to identify gene signatures from diseases as diverse as exertional heat injury (31), sepsis (32), and
multiple sclerosis (33). PBMCs have been used to discriminate
between subjects with healthy lungs and those with lung diseases

such as chronic beryllium disease (34), lung cancer (35), and
pulmonary hypertension (36), as well as to distinguish disease
activity among patients with severe asthma (37), lung cancer
(38), and sickle-cell disease (38). For COPD, the PBMC microarray approach was used previously in small discovery studies of
PBMCs from 38 research subjects (21) and 24 subjects undergoing resection for lung tumors (20), as well as whole-blood leukocytes (which contain predominantly neutrophils) in 67 training
research subjects (22). These cohorts were limited by small sample size as well as a lack of comprehensive phenotyping (e.g., no
emphysema according to high-resolution computed tomography).
However, these studies showed promise for using PBMC gene
expression as a biomarker COPD. The major limitation of human
gene expression studies of COPD, in common with most human
studies, is the inability to determine whether differences in gene
expression are causative or correlative. However, for one of our
candidate genes (ASAH1), we were also able to use a metabolomic
approach to identify a related metabolite (lactosylceramide) as
a biomarker of COPD and emphysema.
The major analytic strategy to interpret hundreds of statistically significant differences in gene expression involves pathway
analysis. Our analysis suggested that subjects with COPD were
more likely to exhibit differences in transcriptional control
(eukaryotic initiation factors 1 and 4, mechanistic target of rapamycin, G-protein signaling mediated by Tubby, and NFAT; see
example in Figure 1), T-cell activation (CD28 signaling in T
helper cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4
signaling in cytotoxic T lymphocytes), oxidative stress signaling
(NO and reactive oxygen species), and metabolic pathways
(sphingolipid metabolism and sphingosine-1–phosphate signaling). The abundance of differentially expressed immune and
inflammatory response genes was not unexpected, considering
that PBMCs were profiled. Although the candidate pathways
were informative, the number of genes in each pathway was prohibitive for replication with a quantitative RT-PCR strategy.
Thus, our strategy for the replication study included the selection
of 46 genes based on a variety of criteria, including the most
highly significant and those represented in pathways of interest.
Some of the highlights of the candidate genes that were significant
in the validation study will be discussed.
ASAH1 encodes the enzyme N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase (acid ceramidase), which catalyzes the degradation of
ceramide into sphingosine and fatty acid. ASAH1 has been associated with the lysosomal storage disorder Farber disease
(39). ASAH1 is highly expressed in the thyroid, lymphocytes,
and lung (according to the Gene Atlas) (40). The knockdown of
rat alveolar macrophage ASAH1 improves the cigarette smoke–
induced inhibition of apoptosis (41). In a recent whole-blood
microarray study using 67 training and 65 test subjects, ASAH1
whole-blood expression was the top candidate biomarker for
distinguishing subjects with and without airflow obstruction
(FEV1/FVC , 0.7 versus FEV1/FVC > 0.7, respectively) (22).
In our study, ASAH1 expression in PBMCs was higher in subjects with severe COPD and emphysema in both the training
and test cohorts. As further evidence of this pathway’s importance in emphysema and COPD, our metabolomic investigations
identified a glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of
emphysema. Interestingly, an abnormal accumulation of galabiosylceramide occurs in Fabry syndrome (angiokeratoma corporis diffusum), and patients with Fabry syndrome are prone to
manifest COPD (42) and emphysema (43). Ceramides are bioactive lipids that mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration, and ceramidases such as acid
ceramidase (ASAH1) catalyze the hydrolysis of ceramides into
sphingosine (44). Thus, acid ceramides play a role in metabolizing ceramides such as galabiosyceramide. We believe that this

is the first report identifying galabiosylceramide as a biomarker
of COPD. However, additional work will be needed to understand more about the role of the glycoceramides in the pathogenesis of emphysema.
Forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) encodes a transcription factor
that is expressed in the lung and is important during lung development (45). FoxP1 protein has been shown to act cooperatively with histone deacetylase 2 to regulate the expression of
IL-6, and it modulates the lung epithelial injury response (46).
In this study, we found that FOXP1 was also expressed in
PBMCs, and that lower expression was associated with both
airflow obstruction and emphysema. Low levels of FOXP1 expression were also reported to be associated with COPD in PBMCs
from subjects undergoing resection for lung cancer (20). FoxP1 has
been shown to play a role in the integrin-dependent modulation of
gene expression and macrophage differentiation (47), and thus
whether FOXP1 gene expression functions through lymphocytes
or is a marker for gene expression in the lung remains unclear.
Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) recognizes single-stranded viral
RNA, and has been associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis
(48). We found that PBMCs expressed significantly lower concentrations of TLR8 in subjects with COPD. The lower expression of TLR8 in patients with COPD could result in increased
susceptibility to viral infections (49).
Vanin 2 (VNN2) codes for a pantetheine hydrolase that is
expressed in most tissues but demonstrates high expression in
leukocytes (50). We observed that subjects with COPD demonstrated lower VNN2 expression in PBMCs. An association between VNN2 expression in whole blood and COPD was also
found in the cohort described by Edmiston and colleagues (22).
The mechanism by which Vanin 2 might cause COPD is unknown.
However, Vanin 2 (formerly called GPI-80) has been shown to
play a role in leukocyte trafficking, and is expressed in alveolar
macrophages (51).
The major limitation of this study is its cross-sectional basis.
This limitation may be assumed to be of minor importance, because the biologic variability of microarray gene expression is very
low over short time periods (1 wk), suggesting the stability of the
gene expression phenotype (52). However, the stability of PBMC
gene expression over longer time periods is unknown, and we do
not know whether these gene expression profiles are predictive of
declines in lung function or the progression of emphysema. Furthermore, in the parent COPDGene study (23), smokers with
normal spirometry were defined as control subjects. Based on
these control subjects, we are not able to assess the effects of
smoking alone in PBMC expression. Others reported that gene
expression is associated with smoking in the oxidative stress response, antiapoptosis and cell-death signaling, and carcinogen metabolism (53–55). However, we found that in our final candidate
genes, the correlation of smoking variables with expression was
either nonexistent or relatively small compared with the effects of
other covariates. Several studies profiled lung tissue in COPD and
emphysema subjects. We did not find a significant overlap in the
PBMC genes identified in the present work and in those previous
studies (data not shown). These results do not suggest a common
signature between PBMCs and lung tissue, but the comparisons
are also based on small sample sizes (n < 30), which compromises
their statistical power. Future work in larger studies or in paired
analyses with blood and lung tissue from the same subjects will be
able to provide more definitive conclusions. Finally, because of
cost and statistical power, the expression profiling was restricted
to one racial and ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites). Although
this is was a large study with an independent replication cohort,
additional gene expression studies in never-smokers and in other
ethnicities and races, and different clinical or research studies,
would improve the generalizability of our findings.

Despite these limitations, by using COPDGene, we were able to
leverage a large, well-phenotyped cohort of subjects with COPD.
The candidate genes identified in this study suggest new disease targets and further mechanistic studies that can be designed to identify
which candidate genes might be important causes of COPD.
In conclusion, this study is, to our knowledge, the largest gene
expression study of smokers with COPD, and demonstrates the
potential for PBMC gene expression to serve as a biomarker of
COPD. The expression of candidate genes was confirmed in two
independent groups with two different assays, and several candidates suggest novel potential targets pathways such as sphingosine-1–phosphate signaling, which were further verified by
a plasma metabolomic approach.
