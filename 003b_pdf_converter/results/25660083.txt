Population epigenetic studies have been seeking to identify differences in DNA methylation between
specific exposures, demographic factors, or diseases in accessible tissues, but relatively little is known about
how inter-individual variability differs between these tissues. This study presents an analysis of DNA
methylation differences between matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) and buccal
epithelial cells (BECs), the two most accessible tissues for population studies, in 998 promoter-located CpG
sites. Specifically we compared probe-wise DNA methylation variance, and how this variance related to
demographic factors across the two tissues. PBMCs had overall higher DNA methylation than BECs, and the
two tissues tended to differ most at genomic regions of low CpG density. Furthermore, although both tissues
showed appreciable probe-wise variability, the specific regions and magnitude of variability differed
strongly between tissues. Lastly, through exploratory association analysis, we found indication of
differential association of BEC and PBMC with demographic variables. The work presented here offers
insight into variability of DNA methylation between individuals and across tissues and helps guide decisions
on the suitability of buccal epithelial or peripheral mononuclear cells for the biological questions explored
by epigenetic studies in human populations.

E

pigenetic analysis is gaining momentum in modern biomedical research, in part because of its potential to
contribute to understanding complex phenotypes1,2. Among the many factors constituting the epigenome,
the best studied is DNA methylation (DNAm), which primarily refers to a methyl group covalently attached
to a cytosine in the context of CpG dinucleotides1–3. Rapid technological advancements allowing routine quantitative measurements of DNAm at multiple CpGs across a large number of subjects have facilitated the integration
of DNAm in human population studies4,5. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are the cousin of
genome-wide association studies (GWAS), primarily aimed at identifying DNAm differences associated with
disease phenotype, progression, or predisposition2,6–9. These studies show that epigenetics is emerging as an
important aspect of human health and disease due to its variability and potential for mediating the interaction
between environmental associations and phenotypic outcomes1,2,10–12.
Population epigenetic studies face the challenge of integrating epigenetic variation with tissue specificity.
Tissue specificity is perhaps the best understood fundamental property of epigenetic biology, with different cell
types and tissues acquiring distinct epigenomes during development13,14. In contrast to specificity, variation of the
epigenome between individuals is not as widely explored, yet it is of great importance for population epigenetics,
as it is a prerequisite for the discovery of any epigenetic association with either exposure or phenotype. It is
reassuring that several studies have recently documented the existence of inter-individual DNAm differences
within a given tissue15–18. Recently, the relevance of DNAm variability in particular to disease models has been
demonstrated. One study showed that DNAm variability of uterine cervix cells differed between subjects who
developed non-invasive cervical neoplasia versus those who were free of the disease19. Another study examined
the relationship between DNAm variability in peripheral blood cells and obesity, and showed that at certain sites,
DNAm exhibited higher variability in case than controls, and these sites enriched for genes associated with obesity
and obesity related diseases20. Finally, a study examining discordance for depression among monozygotic twins

found differences in variance in affected versus unaffected twins21.
Thus it appears that DNAm variability might be associated with
disease risk and progression. Besides disease related variability, factors such as ethnicity, aging, environmental exposures, and genetic
allelic variation together contribute to epigenetic variation between
individuals1,2,12,22,23.
In part, tissue-specific DNAm and inter-individual variance is
linked to distinct promoter structures and their epigenetic properties, particularly the presence of CpG islands (CGIs). CGIs are
regions that harbor a higher than average density of CpG dinucleotides, which are otherwise underrepresented in the genome1–3,24.
Approximately 70% of human gene promoters are associated with
CpG islands, and methylation of CpG islands has been shown to be
highly correlated with gene expression levels4,5,24,25. While several
nuanced classifications for CGIs are in use, the one that provides
the best enrichment discrimination separates CGIs into high CpG
density islands (HCs), intermediate CpG density islands (ICs) and
low CpG density islands (LCs)2,6–9,24,26. In somatic cells, DNAm patterns tend to be correlated with CpG density, as on average, HC
regions have low levels of CpG methylation, while IC and LC regions
have increasingly higher levels1,2,10,12,18,26–29. Epigenetic differences
between tissues are primarily associated with DNAm differences in
IC promoter regions, while reports are inconsistent as to which class
is enriched for CpGs that vary between individuals13,14,16,18,30–32.
Currently, the vast majority of studies in the growing field of
epigenetic epidemiology naturally rely on a limited number of easily
accessible tissues such as blood and BEC due to their availability and
non-invasive nature10,15–18,33. The former often are further processed
to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which are an
immunologically relevant fraction of lymphocytes that lacks multinucleated granulocytes. Importantly, PBMCs are derived from
mesoderm whereas BEC are derived from ectoderm, thus representing two different germ layers and distinct developmental origins.
Given the widespread use of either PBMCs or BECs for inferring
population-level phenotypes, it is important to ask how these tissues
compare in terms of variance, and to reconcile their DNAm variability with tissue specificity. Here, we compared matched PBMCs and
BECs (obtained using cheek swabs) from a small community cohort
of 25 healthy subjects at 998 CpG sites to examine how inter-individual variability differed across tissues. While we found that differences between tissues exceed differences between individuals in the
same tissue, the latter variation had a strong tissue specific component. These tissue-specific differences were also reflected in
exploratory association of DNAm with demographic variables.
Collectively, these findings reveal important considerations for the
selection of surrogate tissues for EWAS10,19,33.

Results
We recruited 25 healthy adults from the Greater Vancouver area to
our study cohort, and collected BEC and PBMC from each individual. This design allowed for a rigorous matched comparison
between the two tissues, eliminating potential confounds due to
inter-individual differences in environments or genetic background. DNAm of 1,506 promoter-associated CpGs biased towards
cancer genes was quantitatively determined using an array-based
approach14,20,34. After removing CpGs located on the sex chromosomes to avoid biases due to our cohort consisting of males and
females and CpGs overlapping with SNPs or annealing to multiple
regions in the genome, as well as 28 CpG sites where more than 3
samples had bad detection p-values, our final dataset consisted of
998 CpGs14,21.
PBMCs and BECs had substantially different DNAm profiles. We
first interrogated broad tissue differences in DNAm across the
population. Each of the 25 individuals had higher mean PBMC
DNAm than BEC DNAm, and this cross-tissue difference was
SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 5 : 8257 | DOI: 10.1038/srep08257

statistically significant by a paired Wilcoxon ranked sum test pvalue of 3.16e-14 (n 5 25, two tailed) (Fig. S1A). While both
tissues had the expected bimodal distribution of DNAm for each
single CpG site across all subjects, there were noticeable differences
in the specific fractions. Categorizing mean CpG methylation
according to a published categorization schema, we found 62.4% of
sites in BEC and 56.9% of sites in PBMC were hypomethylated
(,20%), 16.7% in BEC and 20.3% in PBMC were heterogeneously
methylated (20–80%), and 20.8% in BEC and 22.7% in PBMC were
hypermethylated (.80%) (Fig. S1B)35.
To determine whether differences in DNAm between individuals
or between tissues contribute more to probe-wise variability, we next
compared between-individual and between-tissue correlations.
Across the 998 CpG sites, the average two-tailed Pearson’s correlation coefficient of DNAm profiles among individuals was 0.980 for
BEC and 0.987 for PBMC, and the coefficient between the two tissues
was 0.773 (Fig. 1A). Separating all probes into 212 LCs, 136 ICs,
503 HCs, and 147 uncategorized sites, we found that the relatively
low between-tissue correlation was driven by LCs sites, which had a
mean correlation of 0.514 between PBMCs and BEC; on the other
hand, HC and IC had mean correlations of 0.748 and 0.757, respectively, and uncategorized sites had a higher correlation of 0.795
(Fig. 1B). To explore tissue-specific DNAm in more detail, we identified probes that were differentially methylated between BEC and
PBMC using a paired two sample t-test (n 5 25, two tailed) followed
by Benjamini Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate correction36. With
this approach, we found that 537 CpGs (53.8%) were significantly
different between PBMC and BEC with p-value , 0.001 (Fig. 2A). Of
these significant sites, 178 (17.8%) had a difference in average beta
value (Db) . 0.2 across the two tissues, and 121 of the 178 (12.1%)
had Db . 0.4 (Fig. 2A). Since the collection of 178 probes passed
statistical threshold for significance, and was of reasonable size, we
conducted functional enrichment analysis on the 178 highly tissue
specific probes (located in 137 unique genes) using the online bioinformatics tool DAVID to determine if differentially methylated sites
were representative of cellular processes specific to BEC or
PBMCs26,37. Using the recommended cutoff of enrichment score
$1.3, two clusters were considerably enriched (Table S2). Cluster 1
contained biological process (BP) GO term immune system process
(GO: 0002376) accounting for 30 genes, as well as molecular function
GO term cytokine activity (GO: 0005125) accounting for 11 genes.
Cluster 2 contained cellular component GO term extracellular region
(GO: 0005576) accounting for 48 genes. Both cluster 1 and cluster 2
seemed to be enriching for PBMC and BEC specific processes,
respectively, suggesting a reassuring level of association between
DNAm and the unique functionalities of different cell types.
Stratifying tissue-specific DNAm loci according to CGI density,
we found that LC regions, which constituted only 21% of all CpG
sites on the array (212 out of 998 probes were located in LC regions),
accounted for 31% of the 449 differentially methylated sites (hypergeometric p-value of 1.02e-12 indicating significant enrichment),
consistent with this class having the lowest correlation between
BEC and PBMCs. To further corroborate this finding, we calculated
probewise intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for each of the
three LC, IC, and HC categories. ICC is a reliability index which,
in this case, was used to measure the degree of between-tissue methylation difference: ICC values closer to 21 indicate larger difference
between tissues than within tissues, while ICC values closer to 11
indicate larger within-tissue difference. Distribution of ICC values
showed that the majority of HC and IC probes were clustered around
ICC of 0, indicating equitable within and between tissues differences
(Fig. 2B). On the other hand, LC probes were clustered around ICCs
of 0 and 21, with the latter displaying the most prominent peak,
which means that the majority of LC probes harbored larger between
than within tissue differences. These results thus suggested that tissue
specific DNAm were enriched for regions of low CpG density.

the lowest correlation coefficients.

Variability of DNAm was largely tissue-specific. Having defined
tissue-specific DNAm, we next turned to inter-individual variability
within each tissue and, in particular, how this variability compared
between the two tissues examined. For each CpG site, we calculated
the inter-individual range of beta values for both PBMC and BEC,
and then visualized their overall distribution (Fig. 3A). BEC had a
larger overall DNAm range than PBMC, which was confirmed
statistically by ANOVA on the BEC and PBMC distributions (pvalue of 2.05e-8). Next we determined the degree of variation for
each CpG by calculating the standard deviation (SD) of each CpG site
for the two tissues. In the combined BEC and PBMC data, we
compared the number of highly variable probes across tissues,
using SD . 0.1 and SD . 0.3 as two levels of cutoffs for high
variability. Using a cutoff of 0.1, 123 (12.3%) of PBMC and 150
(15.0%) of BEC loci were variable; using a SD cutoff of 0.3, 26
(2.6%) of PBMC and 55 (5.5%) of BEC loci were variable (Fig. 3B).
To determine the regions at which variable loci were most likely to be
found, we performed hypergeometric tests on CpG density
compositions, and found that variable loci (150 with SD . 0.1) in
BEC were enriched for LC regions (p-value of 2.39e-5, 51 LC loci)
and IC regions (p-value of 2.19e-2, 28 IC loci), but depleted of HC
regions (p-value of 3.51e-8, 45 HC loci). Highly variable BEC loci

with SD . 0.3 (55 loci) were enriched for LC regions (p-value of 0.01,
18 LC loci), but depleted of HC regions (p-value of 0.02, 20 HC loci).
Similar trends were observed for variable loci in PBMCs (SD . 0.1,
123 loci), which were enriched for LC regions (p-value of 1.57e-2,
35 LC loci) and IC regions (p-value of 9.38e-3, 25 IC loci), but
depleted of HC regions (p-value of 4.59e-3, 48 HC loci), though
highly variable PBMC loci (SD . 0.3, 26 loci) were not enriched
or depleted of any particular region.
Taking advantage of our matched study design, we compared
variability of sites between BEC and PBMC directly by calculating
the variance for each probe, and determining equality of variance
using Levene’s test38. This site-by-site evaluation of variance equality
showed that 346 (34.7%) loci did not have equitable variance across
the two tissues (Levene test p-value ,0.05). Of these loci, 144 showed
larger BEC variance, and 202 showed larger PBMC variance. This is
in contrast to the earlier analysis where we found more sites with
large SD in BEC when examining each tissue separately. Plotting the
variance of PBMC versus the variance of BEC, we obtained a
Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.26 (Fig. 4). By setting variance
in BEC as a reference, we searched for probes for which the PBMC
variance deviates more than 620% from the BEC variance. Using
this method we found 584 probes residing within the 620% interval,

and 414 probes outside the interval (Fig. 4). These observations
indicated that variance was specific to the tissue; a probe that was
highly variable in BEC would most likely not behave the same way in
PBMC.
We next sought to find out how similar between-individual patterns of DNA methylation were across tissues. In other words, if
individual a had higher DNAm than individual b at probe i in
PBMC, would the same or opposite trend be observed in BEC. We
carried out a probewise Pearson’s correlation of the DNAm values
between BEC and PBMC and found that only 29 probes displayed
relatively good correlation between the two tissues (absolute
Pearson’s correlation coefficient .0.5) (Fig. S2). A total of 23 probes
out of 29 survived false discovery rate (FDR) correction with a medium confidence FDR of 0.25, and 13 probes survived using a high
confidence FDR of 0.05. This indicated that in most cases, the relative
individual level of DNAm at a specific probe was not translatable
across tissues.
Tissue-specific association between DNAm and demographic
factors. We next performed an exploratory analysis to examine
each tissue individually for associations with a small set of
demographic factors that we had collected in our cohort. Given the
small size of our cohort, these analyses explore how the differences in
variability between BEC and PMBC affect their association with
demographic factors, rather than constituting a statistically
significant determination of specific probes that are associated
with these demographics. As a rough guide to the relative
associations between DNAm and the demographics in our tissues,
in addition to the number of associated probes we also examined the
distributions of unadjusted p-values. As we have previously
described, left skewing of p-value distributions is indicative of a
higher likelihood of association18. The variables examined
included: age (26–45), gender (15 male versus 10 female), ethnicity
(18 Caucasian versus 7 non-Caucasian), and body mass index (BMI,
18.18–47.95). We used a two tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test for
gender and ethnicity, and a Pearson’s two-sided correlation for age
and BMI, and false discovery rate (FDR) was corrected with Storey’s
qvalue method39. No specific probes were found to be associated with
age, but skewed p-value distributions indicated a signature of age
(Fig. 5). Using a FDR # 0.05 (high confidence), in BEC 0 probes were
associated with gender while 4 probes were associated with BMI. The
p-value distributions for the association of gender and BMI with
methylation in BEC were quite different (Fig 5). Gender showed

Figure 4 | DNA methylation variability was tissue specific. 584 probes
had PBMC variance that deviated ,620% from their corresponding BEC
variance. 414 probes were found beyond the 620% threshold, further
demonstrating the variance discordance between BEC and PBMC.

the left-skewing associated with higher confidence associations,
while BMI showed the flat distribution that generally indicates low
likelihood of association (Fig. 5). In PBMCs 40 probes were
associated with gender (10 with Db . 5%), and 51 probes were
associated with BMI (31 with Db . 5% between subjects with
highest and lowest BMI) using an FDR of 0.05 (Table S3). These
results were both supported by their skewed p-value distributions
(Fig. 5).

Discussion
In this study, we took advantage of matched tissue samples from a
cohort of healthy adults to examine basic distribution of DNAm, its
variation between individuals, and its broad association with selected
demographic factors for 998 CpG methylation sites. Given the fundamental role of the epigenome in specifying tissue differences, it was
not surprising that a large fraction of CpGs had substantially different DNAm levels between the two tissues. While the epigenetic differences between tissues greatly overshadowed inter-individual CpG
methylation differences in the same tissues, the latter nevertheless
encompassed a number of loci and revealed some important biological principles. Specifically, we showed that variation in DNAm
can be tissue specific, and in addition, exploratory analysis showed
that the association of DNAm with demographic variables was at
least partly tissue-specific as well. As such, these results have practical
implications for sample selection for population epigenetics studies.
With regards to tissue-specific DNAm marks, our results derived
from matched samples largely confirmed principles from a large
body of published data, most of which were derived from unmatched
samples. We discovered that CpGs differing between tissues were not
only significant in number but also large in the magnitude of absolute
methylation difference. Reassuringly and consistent with the published literature, these CpGs resided primarily in LC regions, and
consequently, these also had by far the lowest pairwise correlation
across tissues13,14,16,18,30–32. This implies that DNAm of PBMC and
BEC is more different at regions of low CpG density than at medium
or high density. We also replicated the finding that BECs have overall
lower DNAm levels than PBMCs2,6,40. The issue of genetic variants
that affect DNAm, known as methylation quantitative trait loci or
mQTLs, is a concern in many epigenetic studies16,41,42. Here, however, our matched design means that our comparisons across tissues
are not confounded with respect to mQTLs, since we performed
paired testing in samples from the same individual. When comparing
across individuals, it is possible that mQTLs contribute to the variance in probes, however we believe this to be highly unlikely as the
overall known percentage of CpG sites associated with mQTLs is
very small, generally estimated between 1% and 7%41,43,44.
Inter-individual variability across human tissues has been investigated in several recent studies15–18. Our matched sample design
allowed us to investigate inter-individual variability across the two
most accessible human tissues. Highly variable probes were identified largely in low CpG density regions in both tissues, a finding
which is consistent with published reports, though overall, studies
are divided on which class of CpG island is the most variable18,30,31. In
our study, several important epigenetic features differed substantially
between the two tissues. First, we found that when examining each
tissue separately, BEC had a larger variable range and contained
more highly variable sites than PBMCs. Second, BEC had a stronger
association between probe variability and CpG island type compared
to PBMC. Third, and perhaps most importantly, CpGs that had a
variable range in one tissue did not necessarily have the same range in
the other tissue. In fact, variance of DNAm for a given site differed at
over a third (34.7%) of loci tested. Also, despite having fewer sites
with high variance overall, PBMCs had more sites with higher variability within the loci that showed discordant methylation between
the two tissues. This observation was particularly important for epigenetic population studies that rely on these easily accessible tissues

Figure 5 | Demographics factors were associated with DNA methylation changes in both PBMC and BEC. Distribution of unadjusted p-values for
association between gender (left), BMI (middle), and age (right) in BEC (top) and PBMC (bottom). Left-skewed p-value distributions showing an
enrichment of CpG sites with small p-values suggested correlations of certain demographic factors with DNA methylation. This is in contrast to the
relatively uniform p-value distribution of BMI and BEC, suggesting lack of such correlation.

for indicators of DNAm variability; depending on which tissue is
chosen for the study, the outcome of identified differentially variable
CpG sites could be vastly different. This could then affect the tissue’s
associations with the biological and deterministic factors that are
often of interest in epigenetics studies.
Consistent with the differences in variability across tissues, we
next showed that associations between DNAm and a small set of
demographic factors were also different between the two tissues. In
particular, while both tissues had CpG sites that were associated with
gender, only PBMCs demonstrated a substantial number probes that
were statistically significant. Similarly, we identified more CpGs
associated with BMI in PBMCs than in BEC, consistent with a recent
report which also showed DNAm associations with BMI in PBMCs45.
Although we did find an age signature from the positive skewing of pvalue for both tissues, we did not find significantly related CpG sites.
The lack of significant age-related sites could be due to the limited age
range (26–45) of this study compared to studies dedicated to examining age-related changes in DNAm (generally ,25 to .75), or to
the relatively restricted distribution of the CpGs analyzed46–49.
Collectively, these results present somewhat of an interesting conundrum: BEC DNAm was more variable across individuals, yet
PBMC DNAm was more strongly associated with the demographic
variables tested here. In contrast, published work suggests that BECs
are a more suitable tissue than peripheral blood for population epiSCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 5 : 8257 | DOI: 10.1038/srep08257

genetic studies40. This was largely based on the finding that BECs
containing more hypomethylated regions than PBMCs, which not
only seem to overlap with hypomethylated regions in other tissues
but also tend to cluster around disease associated SNPs40. However,
given that PBMCs represent a circulating tissue directly involved in
the immune and inflammatory systems and are thus functionally
related to many major diseases, it is our opinion that in most cases,
PBMCs would be the better choice2,35,50. It is of course possible that
for specific studies, selection of the appropriate tissue might be context-dependent, but our results show that for population epigenetics
studies more broadly, the implications of tissue-specific variability
need to be carefully considered when assessing DNAm, in particular
when the primary tissue of interest is not accessible.

Methods
Sample Preparation and DNAm Analysis. All experimental protocols were
approved by the University of British Columbia’s Research Ethics Board, and all
methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. All subjects
gave written consent before participating. Matching buccal and blood samples were
collected from 25 adults in the Greater Vancouver Area. The PBMC fraction was
extracted from blood using density gradient centrifugation, and for both BEC and
PBMC, genomic DNA was extracted using standard techniques. To measure DNAm,
750ng of DNA was treated with the EZ DNAm kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, US)
to convert unmethylated cytosines to uracil, after which DNAm at 1,536 CpG loci
and 371 genes was evaluated using the Illumina GoldenGate Assay for DNAm
profiling as described34. Briefly, for each CpG site there were two allele-specific probes

6

www.nature.com/scientificreports
annealing to either the methylated or the unmethylated sequence. Annealed probes
are then paired to locus-specific oligos, after which the ligated products are amplified
using PCR. DNAm is evaluated as a value between 0–1, otherwise known as beta
values, calculated from the intensity of the methylated and the unmethylated alleles34.
All samples were assayed by random assignment across a single 96 well plate with
parallel processing. It is important to note that our analysis did not differentiate
between DNAm and hydroxymethylation. DNA hydroxymethylation has been
hypothesized to have a functional role outside of DNA demethylation, but as it is
present at significant levels only in neural and pluripotent cells, this function is not
likely to be important in non-neural tissue51.
Data Quality Control and Preprocessing. Before analysis, data was subjected to
stringent quality control. First, we removed all probes for SNPs and X-chromosome
sites. Next, CpG sites where .23 subjects had beta values of zero, as well as sites where
.3 subjects had signals below background detection were removed. Lastly, we
removed probes with polymorphic CpGs that may interfere with the analysis14,27. This
left 998 CpG loci, and 25 subjects ranging from 26 to 45 years in age (10 male and 15
female). Methylation measurements of zero were replaced with the minimum
measurement for either PBMC (0.033) or BEC (0.03). All analysis was performed
using the R statistical computing software (http://www.r-project.org), and statistical
tests were conducted with alpha level of 0.05.
Differential and Tissue Specific DNAm. A probe-wise paired two-sample t-test (n
5 25, two tailed) not assuming equal variance was used to compare the equality of
mean probe methylation across the two tissues. False discovery rate was adjusted
using Benjamini Hochberg correction, after which adjusted p-value 5 0.001 was used
as the significance level. Mean beta values were obtained for the 998 probes in each
tissue by averaging across the 25 individuals. Cross-tissue Db difference was
calculated on a probe-wise basis by calculating the numerical difference between the
average beta values. All statistical tests were conducted with alpha level of 0.05 (the
probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis), which determines the probability of
making a type I error.
Probes with significant differences in beta values between the two tissues were
identified using a combination of t-test results and Db values. Tissue specific probes
were defined as those with t-test p-value smaller than 0.001 and having an absolute Db
of larger than 0.2. Highly tissue specific probes are defined as those with t-test p-value
smaller than 0.001 and absolute Db larger than 0.4.
Intraclass Correlation. The 998 probes were separated into three categories: 1. High
CpG density (HC, CG content .55%, Obs/Exp CpG ratio .0.75 and length
.500 bps) probes; 2. Intermediate CpG density (IC, CG content .50%, Obs/Exp
CpG ratio .0.48 and length .200 bps) probes; and 3. Low CpG density (LC, nonislands or low-density CpG regions, non-HC/IC regions) probes26. Probe-wise
Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated using the one-way consistency
model in the irr R package. Calculation of ICC was done as described in equation (1).
For probe i,
ICCi ~

(MSwithin {MSacross )
(MSwithin zMSacross )

ð1Þ

Where MSwithin is the mean square value for within tissue difference, and MSacross is
the mean square value for across tissue difference. As ICCi approaches 11, the within
tissue difference is larger than the between-tissue difference for probe i; and as ICCi
approaches 21, the between-tissue difference is larger than the within-tissue
difference. Results from ICC offered insight into CpG regions that were more likely to
display methylation difference across tissues.
Correlation between tissues. Pearson’s two-tailed pairwise correlation was used to
assess the comparability of inter-individual DNAm levels across tissues. A Pearson’s
correlation coefficient was calculated for each CpG site by correlating their
methylation measurements for each of the 25 individuals in BEC to their
measurements in PBMC.
Concordance in probe variance across tissues. DNAm range was visualized on a
probewise basis using mean normalization. Range values were calculated as described
in equation (2). For individual j of probe i,

Due to truncation of variance at the extremes of DNAm, a beta value transformation
was applied13,52,53. The transformation was achieved as described in equation (3). For

After transformation, variance was also calculated for each probe and SD was derived
by taking the square root value of variance. A levene’s test for equality of variance was
conducted using the lawstat package in R using transformed BEC and PBMC DNAm
values, and tissue as the grouping factor. P-values from the test were adjusted for false
discovery rate using Benjamini Hochberg correction, and an adjust p-value of 0.05
was used as the cut-off for significance.

DAVID Functional Enrichment Analysis. Entrez gene-ID corresponding to the
998 CpG sites involved in the analysis was used as background for DAVID GO
analysis37. CpG probe lists were tested for enrichment of GO subcategories cellular
component and biological process. Functional enrichment scores of .1.3 were
defined as significantly enriched.
DNAm and demographics. Association between DNAm and demographic factors
gender (15 male vs 10 female) and race (18 Caucasian versus 7 non-Caucasian) was
investigated using the two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test for categorical variables.
Multiple testing adjustments were done using the Storey’s q value method in the
qvalue Bioconductor package. A q value of 0.05 was defined as the significance
threshold. For risk factors BMI and alcohol consumption, association with DNAm
was tested using a two-tailed Pearson’s correlation. Multiple testing adjustments were
again carried out using the q value method, and probes with significant association to
risk factors were defined as those with q value ,0.05.
