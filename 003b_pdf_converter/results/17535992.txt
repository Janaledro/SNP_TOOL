Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Context—A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR)
N363S (rs6195) has been the focus of several clinical studies, and some epidemiological data link
this SNP to increased glucocorticoid sensitivity, coronary artery disease, and increased body mass
index. However, molecular studies in vitro using reporter gene expression systems have failed, for
the most part, to define a link between this polymorphism and altered glucocorticoid receptor
function.
Objective—The objective of this study was to address the biological relevancy of N363S SNP in
GR function by establishing stable U-2 OS (human osteosarcoma) cell lines expressing wild-type
hGR or N363S and examining these receptors under a variety of conditions that probe for GR activity
including human gene microarray analysis.
Design—Functional assays with reporter gene systems, Western blotting, and human microarray
analysis were used to evaluate the activity of wild-type and N363S GR in both transiently and stably
expressing cells. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm the microarray analysis.
Results—Functional assays with reporter gene systems and homologous down-regulation revealed
only minor differences between the wild-type hGR and N363S receptors in both transiently and stably
expressing cell lines. However, examination of the two receptors by human gene microarray analysis
revealed a unique gene expression profile for N363S.

Conclusions—These studies demonstrate that the N363S SNP regulates a novel set of genes with
several of the regulated genes supporting a potential role for this GR polymorphism in human
diseases.
GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTORS (GR) ARE expressed in almost all cells and are necessary
for life. GR signaling at the physiological level is regulated predominantly by the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis where endocrine, neural, and cytokine signaling
converge in the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and regulate the synthesis and
release of CRH. CRH stimulates the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary, which in turn
induces synthesis and secretion of cortisol by the adrenal cortex. Although most cortisol is
bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin in the blood, approximately 10% remains free and is
the biologically active form of the hormone (1). Upon exposure to stress, cortisol levels are
increased and affect almost all physiological systems including carbohydrate, lipid, and protein

metabolism as well as the cardiovascular system, the immune system, behavior, bone density,
and cell growth in addition to the regulation of the HPA axis itself (2). Cortisol also has been
found to be elevated in obese individuals, and dysregulation of the HPA axis was found to be
more pronounced in individuals with central obesity (3). In addition, sensitivity to
glucocorticoids, as measured clinically by dexamethasone suppression tests, varies greatly
among individuals (4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Both natural and synthetic glucocorticoids exert their physiological and pharmacological
effects through binding to the intracellular GR, which upon activation by glucocorticoids,
activate or repress the transcription of target genes. Several polymorphisms in the GR gene
(NR3C1) have been reported in the normal population, and these genetic variations may
influence an individual’s response to glucocorticoids. One such single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) at amino acid 363, which changes the codon from asparagine (N) to
serine (S), was initially identified in a study of Dutch kindred who presented with
hypercortisolism and half the number of GR per cell (5). In another Dutch study, a group of
216 elderly individuals were examined for the N363S polymorphism, and 13 heterozygotes
(6% of the group) were identified (6). Interestingly, these carriers exhibited an increased
sensitivity to exogenously administered glucocorticoids as well as an increased insulin
response and increased body mass index (BMI) (6). In addition, a study using the Trier Social
Stress Test, which assesses cortisol and ACTH responses to psychosocial stress, showed that
N363S carriers had significantly increased salivary cortisol responses to stress (7). In two
studies of Australians (all Caucasian of British descent), Lin et al. (8,9) confirmed this
association of increased BMI with the N363S polymorphism. In a separate study by Lin et
al. (10) on subjects of Anglo-Celtic descent with coronary artery disease (CAD), they reported
that the frequency of the S363 allele was 0.04 in a healthy normal-weight control group but
rose to 0.15 in patients with CAD. This association rose even higher in patients with unstable
angina (0.45), suggesting a role for the N363S polymorphism in the underlying cause of CAD
(10). In a severely obese Italian population, N363S was associated with increased BMI, resting
energy expenditure, and food intake (11). A study by Roussel et al. (12) on French subjects
with type 2 diabetes mellitus also reported an increase in BMI in subjects carrying the N363S
polymorphism. Furthermore, Dobson et al. (13) also showed an association with increased
waist-to-hip ratio in male N363S carriers but no associations with BMI, blood pressure, or
serum cholesterol levels. However, other reports by Halsall et al. (14), Echwald et al. (15),
Rosmond (16), and Buemann et al. (17) have shown no association between N363S and
increased BMI. Interestingly, the N363S variant did not occur in Japanese subjects (18) and
was of extremely low prevalence in a study performed on South Asians living in the United
Kingdom (19).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Biochemical and molecular biological studies examining the ability of N363S to bind ligand
or mediate transcriptional activation of transfected glucocorticoid-responsive promoters have
been largely negative with no differences observed between the variant and the wild-type
receptor (5,6,20,21), although recently, Russcher et al. (22) found a significant but small (8%)
increase in transactivation of a GRELuc reporter gene by the N363S GR. Additionally,
Russcher et al. (22) showed that there was no difference between wild-type and the variant in
dexamethasone-mediated repression of the NF-κB p65 subunit. Thus, the molecular basis for
the altered phenotype seen in some patients carrying the N363S SNP remains undefined.
In this study, we employed functional assays to analyze potential differences between wildtype human GR (hGR) and the N363S variant on gene activation and gene repression in both
transiently transfected and stable cell lines expressing either wild-type or N363S GR. Under
all conditions evaluated, only minimal differences were observed in the ability of N363S and
wild-type hGR to regulate transiently transfected reporter genes. In contrast, examination of
this polymorphism by microarray analysis showed, for the first time, that there are significant

differences between wild-type hGR and the N363S SNP in their ability to regulate gene
expression selectively. Several of these genes may define the link between the N363S SNP
and human disease.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection
COS-1 cells (African Green Monkey kidney cells) were cultured in DMEM-H (GIBCO, Grand
Island, NY) supplemented with a mixture of 10% FCS:CS (fetal calf serum:calf serum), 2
mM glutamine, 100 IU penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. U-2 OS (human osteosarcoma)
cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS:CS, 2 mM glutamine, and
penicillin/streptomycin, and selected clones were maintained in the same media with the
addition of 200 μg/ml Geneticin and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. All cells were maintained in a
humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere.
U-2 OS cell lines stably expressing wild-type hGR and N363S

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To establish the U-OFF parental cell line, the well characterized BD Clontech regulatory
plasmid pTet-Off was transfected into U-2 OS cells (human osteosarcoma). These cells were
chosen because they do not have detectable levels of GR (23). Tet-Off regulates genes
responsive to tetracycline, so to generate the tetracycline-responsive plasmid, pTRE2hGRα,
MluI and EcoRV ends were generated onto the coding region of hGRα using PCR amplification
of the pCMVhGRα plasmid. The pTRE2hyg vector was digested with MluI and EcoRV, and
the two DNAs were ligated (23). Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed to make
pTRE2N363S. The wild-type pTRE2hGRα and the pTRE2N363S plasmids were individually
transfected into the U-OFF cells, and selection was initiated by supplementing the U-OFF
growth media with 500 μg/ml hygromycin. After 4 wk, several colonies, selected for expression
of wild-type hGR or N363S, were transferred to 12-well plates and maintained in growth media
containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin. The receptor levels for each of these cell lines were then
compared using Western blot analyses with the well-characterized anti-GR antibody no. 57
(24). One cell line expressing wild-type hGR and one cell line expressing N363S GR at
comparable levels were chosen for functional assays, microarray analysis, and initial
quantitative RT-PCR studies. In addition, two other cell lines expressing wild-type hGR and
two other cell lines expressing N363S GR were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. All cell
lines were maintained as described above.
Transient transfections and luciferase assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in six-well plates at approximately 80% confluency 1 d before transfection.
Transient transfections were carried out with FuGene 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corp.,
Indianapolis, IN). After 18-24 h, the transfection media were removed, replaced with fresh
medium supplemented with FCS:CS stripped of endogenous glucocorticoids, and treated with
dexamethasone or vehicle (H2O) at the concentrations described. Twenty-four hours after
treatment, cells were harvested in 400 μl Reporter Gene Assay Lysis buffer (Roche) per well.
Cellular debris was pelleted at maximal speed in a refrigerated micro-centrifuge, and the
supernatant was assayed for total protein content by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA). The luciferase activity was measured by using the 96-well plate format with
an MLX automated microtiter plate luminometer from Dynex (Thermo Lab-systems, Helsinki,
Finland) and corrected to the amount of total protein.
Western blotting
Cell extracts prepared for luciferase assays were denatured in a sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer
and then separated on precast 8% Trisglycine gels (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and transferred

to nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline/
0.5% Tween (TBS-T) containing 10% nonfat milk for a 1 h at room temperature, washed in
TBS-T, then incubated with anti-GR antibody no. 57 (1:1000) and anti-β-actin (Chemicon,
Temecula, CA) (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature (24). After additional washing in TBST, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit and anti-mouse secondary
antibodies (1:20,000) for 1 h at RT. Bands were visualized using ECL reagents (Amersham,
Piscataway, NJ). To quantitate the amount of receptor in each band, the wild-type hGR and
N363S GR signals were quantitated densitometrically using NIH Image analysis software and
normalized to the β-actin signal for each band.
Microarray analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Microarray analysis was carried out using Agilent human 1Av2 arrays (Agilent Technologies,
Palo Alto, CA). U-2 OS cells stably expressing either wild-type hGR or N363S were cultured
for 24 h in media containing charcoal-stripped serum and subsequently treated for 6 h with 10
nM dexamethasone or vehicle (H2O), and total RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN RNeasy
midi kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). RNA samples were then amplified using the Agilent lowRNA-input fluorescent linear amplification kit protocol. Total RNA (0.5 μg) was then labeled
with Cy3 or Cy5 following the manufacturer’s protocol. Two-color comparison was then
carried out using 750 ng each of the Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cRNA, which were mixed and
fragmented using the Agilent in situ hybridization kit protocol. Hybridizations were performed
for 16 h in a rotating hybridization oven using the Agilent 60-mer oligo microarray processing
protocol. After this same protocol, slides were washed and then scanned with an Agilent
scanner. Data were obtained using the Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 7.1), using
defaults for all parameters. Each RNA sample was analyzed in duplicate (for a total of eight
chips per analysis), and two experimental samples of RNA, isolated at different times, were
analyzed separately. The gene lists from each analysis were then combined and further analyzed
for genes common between the two individual microarray analyses. The microarray data
discussed in this manuscript have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (25) and is accessible through GEO accession no.
GSE5796.
Real-time PCR analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Three stably expressing cell lines each of wild-type hGR and N363S were cultured for 24 h in
charcoal-stripped serum medium and then treated with 10 nM dexamethasone or vehicle (H2O)
for 6 h, and total RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN RNeasy mini kit. Real-time PCR was
performed using the 7900HT sequence detection system predesigned primer/probe sets
available from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) and following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The signal obtained from each gene primer/probe set was normalized to that of
the unregulated housekeeping gene cyclophilin B primer/probe set (also available from Applied
Biosystems). Each primer/probe set was analyzed with at least three different sets of RNA.
Transient transfections and quantitative RT-PCR analysis
U-2 OS cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at approximately 80% confluency 1 d before
transfection. Cells were transfected with TransIt-LT1 reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) as
described by the manufacturer using 25 μl TransIt-LT1 and 2.5 μg DNA per dish. After 18-24
h, the transfection medium was removed, replaced with charcoal-stripped serum medium, and
further incubated for 24 h at 37 C. The cells were then treated with 10 nM dexamethasone or
vehicle (H2O) for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis was
performed as described.

Results
Analysis of the N363S hGR polymorphism

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To analyze the function of N363S compared with wild-type hGR, we took a two-prong
experimental approach. First, to recapitulate and confirm previous studies in several
laboratories (5,6,20-22), we transiently transfected COS-1 cells with either hGR or N363S.
Second, we generated stable human cell lines expressing either wild-type hGR or the N363S
polymorphism by stably transfecting the receptors into U-OFF cells (U-2 OS cells, human
osteosarcoma), which do not have detectable levels of GR (23). After culturing the transfected
cells for up to 4 wk in selective media containing 500 μg/ml hygromycin, several colonies of
cells expressing either hGR or N363S were transferred to 12-well plates and maintained in 200
μg/ml hygromycin. These stable cell lines were sequenced to confirm that the cells were
expressing either hGR or N363S, and one wild-type (hGR-B5) and one N363S (N363S-A2)
cell line expressing comparable GR protein levels as assessed by Western blot were chosen
for further evaluation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Both the transiently transfected COS-1 cells and the stably expressing U-2 OS cell lines were
then assayed for their ability to activate gene expression. The cell lines were transfected with
the glucocorticoid-responsive promoter GRE2-TATA-Luc and treated with increasing
concentrations of dexamethasone (0-1000 nM) for 24 h. Figure 1, A and B, shows that both
hGR and N363S activated this transient reporter gene to similar levels compared with the 0
nM dexamethasone (control) for each type of receptor in both the transiently expressing COS-1
cells and the stably expressing U-2 OS, although the activity levels of the transiently expressed
GRE2-TATA-Luc were 10-fold higher in the U-2 OS stable cell lines (Fig. 1B). The U-2 OS
cell lines also showed maximal activity at 1 nM dexamethasone. This appears to be cell type
specific or could reflect down-regulation of the GR protein at the higher concentrations.
Western blots of the hGR and N363S protein extracts probed with the anti-GR antibody (no.
57) (24) are shown in the insets and demonstrate that the expression levels of wild-type hGR
and the N363S polymorphism were comparable, suggesting that both transiently and stably
expressed wild-type and N363S GR function similarly.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The ability of the GR to repress the action of the proin-flammatory cytokine, signal transduction
mediator nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is well known (26,27). To determine whether the N363S
polymorphism would have the same repressive effect as wild-type hGR in this model system,
COS-1 cells were transfected with the NF-κB-responsive promoter 3XMHCLuc, the NF-κB
subunit p65, and hGR, N363S, or empty vector (CMV) (Fig. 1C). The U-2 OS stable cell lines,
including the parental cell line U-OFF, were transfected with 3XMHCLuc and the NF-κB
subunit, p65 (Fig. 1D). For the COS-1 transiently transfected cells, cells transfected with
3XMHCLuc, empty vector (CMV) and the NF-κB subunit p65 and treated with vehicle served
as the control. The U-2 OS GR stable cell line control is represented by the U-OFF cells
transfected with 3XMHCLuc and p65 and treated with 100 nM dexamethasone. Figure 1C
demonstrates that there is no significant difference in the repressive effect of hGR or N363S
on p65 NF-κB when this evaluation is made in cells harboring transiently expressed GR. In
addition, neither the transiently expressing COS-1 cells (Fig. 1C) nor the stably expressing U-2
OS cells (Fig. 1D) show a significant difference in dexamethasone-mediated transrepression
between hGR and N363S.
Clinical studies of patients carrying the N363S SNP revealed that carriers have a higher
sensitivity to glucocorticoids (6). Thus, it is possible that this increased sensitivity to
glucocorticoids may result in a greater level of N363S GR homologous down-regulation. To
determine whether there was any difference in glucocorticoid-mediated down-regulation of
the wild-type or N363S expressed proteins, both hGR and N363S transiently expressing COS-1
cells and stably expressing U-2 OS cells were treated with increasing amounts of

dexamethasone (0-1000 nM) for 24 h. Figure 1, E and F, shows a representative Western blot
of hGR and N363S proteins that have been probed with the anti-GR antibody and anti-β-actin
as well as a graphic representation of the data from at least three experiments with the protein
levels normalized to β-actin. The 0-nM dexamethasone treatments served as the controls set at
100%. The data were generated by densitometrically quantitating the GR signal for wild-type
and N363S GR and using the NIH Image software program for analysis of this signal. Together,
these studies demonstrate that there is no difference in homologous down-regulation of the
wild-type hGR or N363S when this physiological process is examined in either transiently or
stably expressing cells.
Gene regulation analysis of U-2 OS cells stably expressing hGR and N363S

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because assays using synthetic reporter genes comprised of consensus DNA elements revealed
no differences in the ability of hGR and N363S to transactivate or transrepress expression of
well characterized synthetic genes, nor did they reveal an altered sensitivity to glucocorticoids,
we used whole-genome microarray analysis to directly compare genes induced or repressed
between hGR and N363S both in the presence and absence of dexamethasone. The U-2 OS
stably expressing cell lines, hGR-B5 and N363S-A2, were cultured for 24 h in charcoalstripped serum media and then treated with 10 nM dexamethasone or vehicle for 6 h, and total
RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis. Each experimental hybridization
consisted of four comparison groups and was run in duplicate: hGR CON (vehicle-treated
control) vs. N363S CON, hGR DEX (treated with 10 nM dexamethasone) vs. N363S DEX, hGR
CON vs. hGR DEX, and N363S CON vs. N363S DEX. The gene lists generated from two
distinct, independent experiments (biological replicates) were analyzed by selecting genes that
were differentially regulated at P < 0.001 and common between two of two biological
replicates. These common gene lists are represented in Figs. 2 and 3. Figure 2A shows the
cluster analysis of these common genes. Those genes shown in green are significantly repressed
and those in red are significantly induced. The mean range represented is 2.5-fold induced to
2.5-fold repressed. This analysis revealed that when N363S is compared with wild-type (hGR
CON vs. N363S CON and hGR DEX vs. N363S DEX), we see a striking change in the pattern
of gene regulation reflecting that expression of the N363S polymorphism is regulating a novel
set of genes even in the absence of added glucocorticoid. Furthermore, treatment with
dexamethasone affects this gene regulation and reveals additional differences between genes
regulated by wild-type hGR- and N363S-expressing cells in the presence of dexamethasone
(hGR CON vs. hGR DEX and N363S CON vs. N363S DEX). Additional analysis of these data
using human chromosome mapping and comparing genes affected by the glucocorticoidtreated wild-type-expressing cells (hGR CON vs. hGR DEX) and the treated N363S-expressing
cells (N363S CON vs. DEX) shows the physical position of the genes with known loci (Fig.
2B). This figure illustrates that there are differences in the genes affected by the expression of
these receptors across the entire human genome. The structure of each chromosome is depicted
in gray, up-regulated genes are red, and down-regulated genes are green. The color bar on the
right shows the expression level of these genes ranging from 5.0 (highly up-regulated) to 0.1
(highly down-regulated). Differences in the genes affected by these two different GRexpressing cell lines are apparent on every chromosome.
This diversity in the ability of the N363S to selectively signal is further illustrated in the Venn
diagrams. Figure 3A reveals that expression of N363S (left-hand circle, hGR CON vs. N363S
CON) significantly regulated a total of 191 novel genes compared with wild-type hGR (the
comparison control). Of these genes, 134 were up-regulated and 57 were down-regulated.
When treated with 10 nM dexamethasone and compared with wild-type hGR treated with
dexamethasone (right-hand circle, hGR DEX vs. N363S DEX), 179 genes were detected with
112 up-regulated and 67 down-regulated. Of these, 179 genes, 100 were novel to the expression
of N363S in the presence of dexamethasone. The other 79 genes, common between the

overlapping circles, represent those genes that were regulated by N363S but were not further
regulated by treatment with dexamethasone. Figure 3B displays a Venn diagram comparing
the effects of dexamethasone on genes regulated by the expression of wild-type hGR vs. N363S.
On the left, wild-type hGR-expressing cells regulated 98 genes when treated with 10 nM
dexamethasone (hGR CON vs. hGR DEX). Of these 98 genes, 72 genes were up-regulated
(73%) and 26 genes were down-regulated (27%). On the right, we see that N363S-expressing
cells treated with dexamethasone (N363S CON vs. N363S DEX) regulated a total of 221 genes
with 126 genes up-regulated (57%) and 95 down-regulated (43%). Fifty-three genes were
commonly regulated by dexamethasone in both the hGR-expressing cells and the N363Sexpressing cells. Additionally, it is interesting to note that DEX treatment of N363S-expressing
cells caused down-regulation of more genes than wild-type hGR (43 vs. 27%), whereas the
majority of genes in the dexamethasone-treated wild-type-expressing cells were up-regulated
(73 vs. 57%). Thus, our microarray analysis revealed 1) that N363S could regulate a novel set
of genes when compared with hGR, 2) that an additional 100 novel genes were regulated in
the N363S cells after treatment with dexamethasone, and 3) that dexamethasone treatment
commonly regulated a number of genes in both hGR- and N363S-expressing cells. All of the
genes regulated by both the wild-type hGR and N363S polymorphism have been deposited in
NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, accession no. GSE5796).

We next verified several genes from the microarray data that were highly up-regulated or highly
down-regulated in the N363S-expressing cells compared with wild-type hGR-expressing cells
and confirmed these genes using quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3, C and D). Interestingly,
the serum amyloid A (SAA) family of proteins, which are increased in plasma concentration
during acute inflammatory reactions and involved in cholesterol metabolism (28) and includes
SAA1, SAA2, and SAA4, were among some of the genes highly up-regulated by the N363S
polymorphism but were unaffected by dexamethasone. This result was confirmed by
quantitative RT-PCR. Figure 3C shows that the mRNA levels of SAA1, SAA2, and SAA4
were significantly up-regulated by expression of N363S both in the absence and presence of
hormone (N363S-A2 CON and N363S-A2 DEX), but neither wild-type hGR nor N363S was
further regulated by the addition of dexamethasone. One of the genes most highly downregulated by N363S was protein kinase inhibitor B (PKIB), which is a member of the human
cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor gene family. Another highly down-regulated gene
was adenylate kinase 5 (AK5), which plays an important role in the synthesis of adenine
nucleotides that are required for cellular metabolism. This down-regulation of gene expression
was confirmed by RT-PCR. Figure 3D demonstrates that both PKIB and AK5 were
significantly down-regulated by N363S both in the absence and presence of hormone (N363SA2 CON and N363S-A2 DEX) and, furthermore, that dexamethasone down-regulated PKIB
in both wild-type and N363S-expressing cells. However, AK5 was not significantly regulated
by DEX in either wild-type or N363S-expressing cells.
To further determine whether the N363S effect on gene regulation was specific to the
expression of N363S, two other cell lines of either wild-type hGR (hGR-A1 and hGR-C3) or
N363S (N363S-A6 and N363S-B1) were assayed for their affects on SAA1, SAA2, and PKIB
using quantitative RT-PCR. We first analyzed the receptor protein expression levels of each
cell line by Western blot. Figure 4A graphically depicts the relative protein levels of each GRexpressing cell line when normalized to actin (Fig. 4A, inset). Total RNA was then prepared
from each cell line treated with 10 nM dexamethasone or vehicle for 6 h, and gene regulation
was assayed using quantitative RT-PCR. Figure 4, B-D, shows the effect of N363S expression
on the regulation of SAA1 (Fig. 4B), SAA2 (Fig. 4C), and PKIB (Fig. 4D). Despite the
differences in expression level of each of the cell lines, SAA1 and SAA2 were significantly
up-regulated and PKIB was significantly down-regulated by the expression of N363S (N363SA6 and N363S-B1 compared with hGR-A1 and hGR-C3). This consistent pattern of gene

regulation occurred despite the fact that these different cell lines contain diverse levels of hGR
(Fig. 4A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally, we wished to determine whether genes identified by the microarray and confirmed in
all of our stable cell lines could be studied in the context of a heterologous system using
transfected receptors. Thus, we transiently transfected U-2 OS cells with either wild-type hGR
or N363S, treated the cells with 10 nM dexamethasone or vehicle for 6 h, and isolated total
RNA. The samples were then assayed for gene regulation using quantitative RT-PCR. Figure
4E clearly shows that even the transient expression of N363S can affect gene regulation of
SAA1, SAA2, and PKIB. Interestingly, in the transiently transfected U-2 OS cells, there was
a further up-regulation of SAA1 and SAA2 in the presence of dexamethasone that was not seen
in the stably expressing cell lines. In addition, dexamethasone had no further effect on the
down-regulation of PKIB in either the wild-type or N363S transiently expressing cells
compared with those stably expressing GR. This difference in dexamethasone-mediated
regulation in the stable vs. transiently transfected cells is most likely due to differences in the
high expression level of the GR that is well known to occur during transient transfection.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

These data confirm that the expression of N363S GR regulates a novel set of genes in
comparison with wild-type hGR. Thus, when one uses the correct endogenous genes selectively
regulated by the N363S polymorphism, one can recapitulate data from the stable cell lines in
a transient system. This discovery will allow us to elucidate the molecular basis for this
polymorphism’s altered gene expression.

In this study, we have analyzed the differences between wild-type hGR and the hGR SNP
N363S that has been associated with higher glucocorticoid sensitivity, increased insulin
response to dexamethasone, CAD, and obesity, specifically, with an increase in BMI (6,8,
10-12). Under our experimental conditions, the data presented here revealed no major
differences between wild-type hGR and the N363S polymorphism when transactivation and
transrepression were assayed in cells transiently transfected with synthetic reporter genes
comprised of consensus hormone or transcription factor elements (Figs. 1, A and C). These
results support most of the previous reports (5,6,20,21), although recently Russcher et al.
(22) demonstrated that N363S had a small but significant increase in transactivating capacity
on a GRE-LUC reporter. In addition to the transactivation and transrepression assays, we
analyzed each GR for its ability to undergo hormone-mediated down-regulation in a dosedependent manner, and again, we found no difference between the N363S polymorphism and
wild-type hGR (Fig. 1E). Because transient transfection assays can be variable from one
experiment to the next, they may not reveal subtle differences when comparing the expression
and function of two different proteins when one uses synthetic reporter elements. Therefore,
we created stable cell lines overexpressing either hGR or N363S to eliminate some of this
potential variability.
Lu and Cidlowski (23) in our laboratory analyzed the differences between the wild-type human
GR and its isoforms using stable cell lines expressing either wild-type hGR or each isoform.
Using this same expression system, we produced stable cell lines expressing either wild-type
hGR or the N363S SNP. Even though creation of the stable cell lines gave us cells expressing
equal amounts of hGR and N363S proteins (Fig. 1B), thus reducing some of the variability
associated with transient transfection assays, the functional assays with the stable cell lines
revealed little or no difference between wild-type hGR and N363S (Fig. 1, B, D, and F). These
data also argue against the 363 asparagine to serine change becoming an additional site for
phosphorylation of the GR protein because our laboratory has previously shown that the
greatest differences in transactivation of the mGR phosphorylation site mutants was seen using

the simple GRE2-TATA promoter (29). In addition, the amino acid sequences surrounding the
serine site do not correspond to the published consensus sequence (30).

Therefore, we used gene array analysis to determine whether there was differential regulation
between the two cell lines in the absence and presence of dexamethasone. Although we cannot
rule out that residual glucocorticoids were still present in the cells at the time of our analysis,
our microarray results show, for the first time, that the N363S polymorphism can regulate a
novel set of genes in comparison to wild-type hGR both in the absence and presence of
dexamethasone (Figs. 2 and 3). These data were confirmed using several populations of cells
expressing different levels of receptor (Fig. 4). Together these data suggest that the N363S
phenotype may be the result of differential effects on gene regulation. Interestingly, the effect
of the polymorphism, in the absence of dexamethasone, could be recapitulated in a transient
transfection system which will now allow us to dissect the molecular basis for altered gene
expression.

One interesting family of genes involved in the response to external stimulus (which includes
immune response) is the SAAs. These acute-phase proteins, precursors of amyloid A (AA),
which is involved in the pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis, are produced primarily in the liver
and increase many-fold during inflammation. During the acute inflammatory response, the
circulating levels of SAA rise dramatically within 24 h of an inflammatory stimulus (28). SAA
along with C-reactive protein (CRP) are the major acute-phase protein responders and are
regulated by cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF, although how they are regulated is not
precisely known (28). Because SAA increases where tissue damage has occurred with
subsequent inflammation, patients who have suffered myocardial infarctions also have elevated
SAA levels (28). This has led to SAA being investigated as a prognostic indicator, along with
CRP, for acute myocardial infarction (31). Interestingly, the SAAs were among the genes most
highly up-regulated in the N363S-expressing cells. However, it remains unclear whether the
increased SAA levels in the U-2 OS cell lines expressing the N363S SNP can be associated
with the increase in CAD in carriers of the SNP as reported by Lin et al. (10), although clearly,
further study is now warranted.

Although CRP and IL-6 have been previously associated with parameters of obesity, only
recently has SAA also been investigated in relation to body composition (32). In a large study
in both men and women in the area of Augsburg, Germany, both total adiposity (fat mass, BMI)
and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio) were measured, and these
measurements correlated with markers of systemic inflammation CRP, SAA, fibrinogen, and
IL-6. Their study discovered that adiposity was strongly associated with these markers of
systemic inflammation in both men and women and that this correlation, especially for CRP,
was even stronger in women. Other studies have not only associated SAA and CRP with obesity
but also found that weight loss significantly decreased the levels of SAA and CRP (33-35). Of
these studies, Poitou et al. (34) found that SAA1, SAA2, and SAA4 transcripts were
overexpressed in the sc white adipose tissue of obese women compared with the lean controls.
In addition, Gomez-Ambrosi et al. (35) found high levels of SAA mRNA transcripts in the
omental adipose tissue of morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery. In all
three of these studies, weight loss whether by diet (33,34) or gastric bypass (35) was associated
with a significant decrease in SAA. Finally, O’Brien and Chait (36) suggest that SAA and CRP
may be chronically elevated in individuals with conditions such as atherosclerosis, insulin
resistance, diabetes, and obesity leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Again,
although these findings are tantalizing, we cannot yet draw a direct correlation between the
obesity phenotype observed in N363S carriers with an increase in SAA levels observed in our
stably expressing U-2 OS cells.

There were many other genes that were differentially regulated by the N363S SNP compared
with wild-type GR, with the majority of the genes involved in biological processes such as cell
growth/maintenance and nucleic acid metabolism. However, the most notable aspect of our
study is that the N363S SNP does regulate a novel set of genes in comparison with wild-type
hGR. Additional studies will be needed to correlate specific genes with the N363S phenotype
and provide a molecular understanding of the ability of the polymorphism to selectively
regulate these genes.

cells with either wild-type hGR or N363S. After treatment with increasing concentrations of
dexamethasone ranging from 0-1000 nM for 24 h, proteins were isolated, and protein levels
were assessed by Western blotting with anti-GR antibody (no. 57) and anti-β-actin. The
Western blot pictured is one blot representative of three. To generate the graph, protein levels
were normalized to actin and the 0 nM dexamethasone (vehicle) controls set at 100% (n = 3).
F, Down-regulation of the hGR-B5 and N363S-A2 stably expressed proteins was assayed by
