networks associated with skeletal muscle
wasting in simian immunodeficiency
virus-infected macaques

Abstract
Background: There are more than 1 million persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in the United States and
approximately 40 % of them have a history of alcohol use disorders (AUD). Chronic heavy alcohol consumption and
HIV/AIDS both result in reduced lean body mass and muscle dysfunction, increasing the incidence of comorbid
conditions. Previous studies from our laboratory using rhesus macaques infected with Simian Immunodeficiency
Virus (SIV) demonstrated that chronic binge alcohol (CBA) administration in the absence of antiretroviral therapy
exacerbates skeletal muscle (SKM) wasting at end-stage SIV disease. The aim of this study was to characterize how
CBA alters global gene regulatory networks that lead to SKM wasting at end-stage disease. Administration of
intragastric alcohol or sucrose to male rhesus macaques began 3 months prior to SIV infection and continued
throughout the duration of study. High-output array analysis was used to determine CBA-dependent changes in
mRNA expression, miRNA expression, and promoter methylation status of SKM at end-stage disease (~10 months
post-SIV) from healthy control (control), sucrose-administered, SIV-infected (SUC/SIV), and CBA-administered/
SIV-infected (CBA/SIV) macaques.
Results: In addition to previously reported effects on the extracellular matrix and the promotion of a
pro-inflammatory environment, we found that CBA adversely affects gene regulatory networks that involve
“universal” cellular functions, protein homeostasis, calcium and ion homeostasis, neuronal growth and signaling, and
satellite cell growth and survival.
Conclusions: The results from this study provide an overview of the impact of CBA on gene regulatory networks
involved in biological functions, including transcriptional and epigenetic processes, illustrating the genetic and
molecular mechanisms associated with CBA-dependent SKM wasting at end-stage SIV infection.

Background
An estimated 1.15 million persons are living with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLWHA) in the United States
[1, 2]. With the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV is
now a chronic disease with higher incidence of associated
non-AIDS defining illnesses. PLWHA have a higher
prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) than the general population [3]. Chronic heavy alcohol consumption
accelerates the progression of HIV/AIDS and contributes
to comorbid pathologies seen in PLWHA [4]. Among the
different pathophysiological comorbidities that enhance
the progression of the disease, decreased muscle mass/
function remains a strong and consistent predictor of
mortality, with the frequency of low skeletal muscle
(SKM) mass detected at a much younger age in PLWHA
compared to that of the general population [5, 6].
Chronic heavy alcohol consumption and HIV both
result in significant SKM derangements such as atrophy, weakness, and dysfunction [5, 7–10]. However,
there are few reports that describe the comorbid effects of chronic alcohol consumption and HIV on
SKM biology [11–13]. Our previous studies provided
evidence that chronic binge alcohol (CBA) administration accentuates metabolic derangements [11, 12,
14, 15], leading to a marked decrease in SKM mass
(SAIDS wasting) and dysfunctional skeletal muscle
phenotype, thereby accelerating the time to end-stage
disease in SIV-infected macaques [12]. Decreased
mass and dysfunctional SKM phenotypes are associated with changes in gene expression levels —
changes that were functionally correlated to the generation of an inflammatory milieu, dysregulation of
components of the ubiquitin proteasome system,
increased proteasomal activity, depletion of SKM antioxidant capacity, and an increased expression of profibrotic genes [13, 14]. In subsequent studies we
further demonstrated the relevance of these observed
gene expression changes by showing that CBA impairs the differentiation potential of myoblasts to
form myotubes, suggesting that SKM regeneration is
adversely affected [16]. Taken together, our studies
provide strong evidence that CBA accelerates the loss
of SKM mass and impairs regeneration potential,
which we predict would decrease quality of life and
increase morbidity and mortality among PLWHA.
In order to understand the underlying genetic and
molecular mechanisms that contribute to CBAdependent SKM wasting at end-stage SIV, we previously examined the pattern of dysregulation of several
key genes involved in biological processes required
for SKM homeostasis [13, 14, 16]. Although these
studies were informative, they provided only part of
the larger picture, since CBA/SIV produces multi-

systemic and dynamic changes that disrupt finely
tuned and highly integrated global gene regulatory
networks. These networks include multiple molecular
processes, including the initiation of transcription and
epigenetic mechanisms such as methylation of promoters and the post-transcriptional regulation by
microRNAs. Therefore, the global analysis of the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles from tissues derived from CBA/SIV whole animal studies was
considered to be invaluable for understanding how
CBA disrupts the interaction, integration, and function of these global gene regulatory networks to contribute to SKM wasting at end-stage SIV infection.
In this study we utilized high-output microarray
gene analysis using RNA and/or DNA isolated from
SKM tissue derived from CBA-administered rhesus
macaques at end-stage SIV infection to determine
CBA-dependent changes in mRNA expression,
miRNA expression, and promoter methylation status.
Our results provide a model that describes the impact
of CBA on global transcriptional and epigenetic networks that disrupt the complex interplay between
biological functions, thereby disrupting normal SKM
function. In addition to the previously described
changes in expression of genes that promote a proinflammatory environment and impair the integrity
and composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM)
[13], our results showed changes in gene regulatory
networks that disrupt calcium and ion homeostasis,
neuromuscular junction (NMJ), satellite cell growth
and survival, “universal” functions of the cell (e.g.,
glycolysis) and protein homeostasis. This is the first
report to describe the effects of CBA on SKM gene
regulatory networks, providing a more comprehensive
picture of the genetic and molecular mechanisms
underlying CBA-dependent SKM wasting at end-stage
SIV infection.

Results
Chronic binge alcohol-dependent mRNA expression
changes

A total of 431 genes were significantly increased and 404
genes were significantly decreased in a CBA-dependent
manner. Functional enrichment analysis was performed
using GSEA as described in methods. In the CBA/SIV
group, there were 74 gene sets that were upregulated
among 111 gene sets. Of these 74 gene sets 36 were significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 25 % and of
these, 27 gene sets are significantly enriched at a pvalue < 0.05. (Fig. 1a, Additional file 1: Table S1). Pathways associated with transcription, programmed cell
death, response to stress, protein kinase cascade and
others were enriched in the CBA/SIV group (Fig. 1b). In

the SUC/SIV group, there were 37 upregulated gene sets
among 111 total gene sets (Additional file 1: Table S1).
However, there were no gene sets that were significantly
enriched according to the FDR or p-value.
In addition to previously described changes in genes
affecting the inflammatory response, oxidative stress response, ECM reorganization [13], and enzymes involved
in the ubiquitin mediated degradation of proteins and
initiation of translation [14, 17], we found that CBA altered the expression of genes in five additional distinct
biological categories: (1) “universal” cellular functions,
(2) protein homeostasis, (3) calcium and ion homeostasis, (4) muscle and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) function, and (5) myogenesis, encompassing muscle satellite
growth and survival.

functions were significantly different in the CBA/SIV
group. Of these genes, 18 encode proteins important
for the production of energy, including 5 of the upregulated genes required for the metabolism of alcohol and 10 of the downregulated genes involved in
the glycolytic pathway and glycogen degradation, connecting glycolysis to the TCA cycle and the respiratory pathway. CBA also altered the expression of
genes required for histone remodeling and modification (9
genes), multifunctional transcriptional regulators (27
genes), general kinases and phosphatases (22 genes), lipid
biosynthesis and degradation (11 genes), mitochondrial
function (12 genes), along with other individual genes
important for the general functioning of the cell.
Protein homeostasis category

“Universal” cellular functions category

One hundred twenty three genes encoding enzymes
that can be viewed as having “universal” cellular

CBA/SIV altered the expression of 39 genes important
for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleic acids, enzymes essential for the proper charging of tRNA and

Simon et al. BMC Genomics (2015) 16:1097

ribosome biogenesis, proteins utilized in the splicing and
maturation of mRNA, and multifunctional transcription
factors that regulate the initiation of transcription
(Additional file 2: Table S2). Further, 11 genes required
for the trafficking of proteins through the endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi apparatus and the glycosylation of
proteins in these cellular compartments had altered expression, suggesting that the effects of CBA on protein
homeostasis not only encompass the initiation of translation and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, but
also involve all aspects from the generation of components
required for synthesis to the proper post-translational
modifications required for functional mature proteins.
Calcium and ion homeostasis category

CBA altered the expression of 25 genes important for
calcium homeostasis and 23 genes that encode ion channels. We also found that CBA increased the expression
of two calcium-dependent cadherins, which are important for muscle development, and one calciumdependent gene necessary for neuronal development.
Muscle and NMJ function category

Among the 13 differentially expressed genes involved in
muscle differentiation, one encoded a myogenic factor
directly involved in promoting or inhibiting myogenic
differentiation, myogenic enhancing factor 2C (MEF2C).
A CBA-dependent decrease in the expression of genes
required for proper contractile function, cell structure
and integrity, and cellular expansion was also observed
(Additional file 2: Table S2). We found an increased expression of pinin desmosome-associated protein (PNN),
a gene that reverses the expression of E-cadherin, an adhesion molecule required for muscle differentiation.
Consistent with increased collagen deposition and the
pro-fibrotic environment in muscle wasting [13], CBA
increased the expression of the gene encoding the transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119), which drives the
differentiation of myoblasts into osteoclasts, a cell type
that promotes the deposition of collagen. CBA altered
expression of genes important for neuronal survival and
regeneration, CNS development, acetylcholine receptor
expression, and neuronal organization and orientation,
consistent with a CBA-mediated alteration of NMJ and
normal muscle function.
Muscle satellite cell growth and survival category

Consistent with our previous findings that CBA impairs skeletal muscle regenerative capacity, the results
from this study showed that CBA altered the expression of
38 genes that contribute to the growth, survival, and cell
cycle regulation of cells. These include genes important for
cell cycle progression, growth factor related signaling pathways, cellular survival and apoptosis, and additional genes

Page 4 of 16

(including kinases, transcription factors, and co-regulatory
proteins) that mediate or contribute to cellular proliferation and/or survival. We previously published reports that
demonstrate the functional relevance of many of these differentially expressed genes [13].
Chronic binge alcohol-dependent mirna expression
changes

We identified 35 miRNAs whose expression changed
≥1.5-fold in a CBA-dependent manner. Of these, 14
were downregulated and 21 were upregulated (Fig. 2a).
Functional enrichment of predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs was analyzed using miRsystem as described in the methods section. Pathways
associated with MAPK signaling, insulin signaling, neuronal signaling, and focal adhesions were enriched
(Fig. 2b). The 100 most enriched pathways that included
≥20 differentially expressed miRNAs, ≥20 target genes,
and had a score ≥1 are shown in Table 1. Target genes
from additional pathways showed a higher representation of proteins important for essential enzymes or cofactors in ubiquitin-mediated degradation of proteins,
genes involved in maintenance of the integrity or in the
breakdown of the extracellular matrix and muscle contraction (Additional file 3: Table S3).
Expression values for 3 upregulated candidate miRNAs
(miR-34a, miR-10b and miR-20) in the microarray were
confirmed by qPCR (Fig. 2c). We observed significant
CBA/SIV-dependent changes in miRNA gene expression
consistent with our microarray results. We also determined expression levels of 3 mRNAs: (1) estrogen
receptor-alpha (ESR1), which demonstrated CBA/SIVdependent changes in the microarray results and serves
as a validated target of miR-34a and −20, (2) B-cell
lymphoma-2 (BCl-2), a validated target of miR-34a, and
(3) Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS), a validated target of
miR-18. We found significant changes in ESR1 that were
consistent with our microarray, and all mRNA showed
significant changes with the expected inverse correlation
to miRNA changes (Fig. 2c).
As described in the methods, we also analyzed biological
functions of target genes of differentially regulated miRNAs. Genes targeted by downregulated miRNAs are involved in inflammatory/immune response, general cellular
functions, neuronal function, etc. Frequently, a single gene
was targeted by a miRNA within each individual biological
function. Nearly 50 % of the genes targeted by upregulated
miRNAs are primarily associated with five biological functional groups including (1) regulation of cell cycle progression, (2) activation of the innate immune response upon
viral infection, (3) control of neuronal survival and plasticity, CNS development, and neuronal differentiation,
(4) multifunctional receptors that mediate several cellular functions (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, glucose

protein kinase (MAPK) and transforming growth factor
(TGF) β signaling (Additional file 4: Table S4).
Chronic binge alcohol-dependent methylation changes

A total of 112 genes had alcohol-dependent changes in promoter methylation of ≥1.5-fold (12 had decreased and 100
had increased promoter methylation) (Additional file 5:

Table S5). Eight of the genes with decreased methylation
and 16 of the genes with increased methylation correspond
to genes up- or downregulated, respectively, in the mRNA
gene expression array. The major BPs that genes with
differential methylation expression are involved in are
transmission of nerve impulse, cell communication, ion
homeostasis, glucose metabolism and cellular processes
(Table 2).

Simon et al. BMC Genomics (2015) 16:1097

Examination of the genes in which an increase in promoter methylation was observed; which would be predicted to result in a decrease in gene expression,
demonstrated that nearly 70 % of the genes affected
belonged to five biological functional groups and some
showed overlap. The genes altered are involved in transcription, RNA processing, translation, and trafficking of
proteins. Additional genes are involved in pathways including the Notch, TGFβ, Wnt, MAPK, nuclear factor
kappa B (NFkB), Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and
insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling. Other functions of genes that were altered included cellular adhesion, cell growth and survival, energy production,
myogenic function, oxidative stress response, extracellular matrix proteins, and ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
As seen with the miRNA results, most of the genes
that could be affected by a decrease in methylation in
their promoter are not involved in any one particular
biological function (Additional file 5: Table S5). A small
number (<3 per category) of genes affected by decreased
methylation contribute to general cellular functioning,
actin proteins, proteins of the extracellular matrix, energy metabolism, cellular adhesion, cell growth, and
neural functioning. These results suggest that decreased
gene promoter methylation minimally contributes to accentuated SKM loss in CBA/SIV macaques.

Discussion
We examined the SKM transcriptional and epigenetic
changes, including differential expression of miRNA and
promoter methylation profile, resulting from CBA administration to SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The results obtained were used to develop a gene regulatory
network illustrating the principal sites of CBA-mediated
alterations associated with SKM wasting at end-stage
SIV infection. Our results show that CBA disrupts complex gene regulatory networks that affect the interplay
between transcriptional and epigenetic factors leading to
altered expression of genes whose biological functions
contribute to one or more of the physiological events
important for normal muscle functioning, including
muscle regeneration to repair injury, muscle contraction
and tensile strength, protein homeostasis, and NMJ
function and development.
We and others previously focused on alcoholmediated alterations in a single gene or class of genes
involved in such biological functions of protein homeostasis [11, 18, 19], responses to increased oxidative stress
[17], or immunological function [12]. Using new, more
affordable genomics techniques and bioinformatics
analytical methods, our previous, more limited SKM
microarray analysis showed differential expression of
genes-expression changes that were shown to be

Page 6 of 16

functionally involved in pro-inflammatory and ECM remodeling processes in SKM of CBA/SIV macaques [13].
In the present study, we expanded the analysis of this
microarray data set to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of how CBA disrupts complex gene regulatory networks, thereby elucidating some additional
underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to
CBA-dependent accentuation of SKM wasting at endstage SIV infection.
Gene regulatory networks have both transcriptional
and epigenetic components, including regulation of the
initiation of gene expression through the action of
transcription factors, the pre-transcriptional epigenetic
regulation through promoter methylation, and the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA stability or translation through the action of microRNAs (Fig. 3). Consistent with the interplay between these events, we
identified several instances in which changes in methylation status (24 genes affected), miRNA expression (1
gene affected), or both (1 gene affected) are inversely
proportional to our observed CBA-dependent changes
in mRNA gene expression (Fig. 3). However, the majority of genes with expression changes ≥1.5-fold (as compared to expression in SUC/SIV macaques) did not
correlate with alterations in miRNA or methylation. This
suggests that the activation or repression of transcription
initiation, that are independent of epigenetic modulation,
are the most likely regulatory mechanisms responsible
for these changes in gene expression. Further, a majority
of genes that are affected by promoter methylation or
that are validated/predicted targets of miRNA were not
seen in our mRNA data, suggesting that these epigenetic
changes have more subtle effects on the expression of
individual genes (<1.5-fold change).
The results from these studies identify four additional
distinct biological categories in which gene regulatory
networks are altered in a CBA-dependent manner: (1)
“universal” cellular functions, (2) protein homeostasis,
(3) calcium and ion homeostasis, which affect the functioning of muscle and neuromuscular junctions, and (4)
satellite cell growth and survival (Fig. 4).
“Universal” cellular functions

We found that 22 % of mRNAs, 18 % of target genes of
altered miRNAs, and 21 % genes with promoters whose
methylation status changed are involved with “universal”
cellular functions. These universal functions include glycolysis and energy production, histone remodeling and
modification, multifunctional transcriptional regulators,
general kinases and phosphatases, lipid biosynthesis and
degradation, multifunctional signaling pathways, maintaining DNA and chromosome integrity, transport of
large molecules, and general mitochondrial function. Although seemingly diverse, and although each may not

independently have a large biological impact, these
changes combined as a whole would be expected to have
a significant effect on the ability of any cell to function,
regardless of the tissue of origin.
Protein homeostasis

Previous findings from our laboratory have demonstrated
that CBA may disrupt protein homeostasis through altered
insulin signaling and increased ubiquitin-proteasomedependent protein degradation [20], possibly inhibiting
protein synthesis by altering mTOR signaling [21], and affecting translation elongation [22]. Consistent with these
previous reports, we found changes in gene regulatory networks that affect all three of these biological functions.
However, we also detected effects on gene regulatory networks whose functions contribute to additional aspects of
protein homeostasis, including the biosynthesis of nucleotides and amino acids, the generation of charged tRNA,
the formation of functional ribosomes, transcription, processing and editing of mRNA, oligosaccharide biosynthesis, and trafficking of proteins through the endoplasmic
reticulum and trans-Golgi network. Thus, CBA impacts
processes preceding transcription and culminating in the
production of fully modified functional proteins or glycoproteins. Interestingly, although methylation changes influence genes with varied biological functions, nearly 25 %
of genes are involved with protein homeostasis, suggesting
that the largest impact of changes in methylation is on
finer modulation of genes important for the production of
functional proteins.
Calcium and ion homeostasis

The increases in intracellular calcium stores, mediated
through the mobilization and influx of calcium, are

essential for many aspects of proper muscle functioning,
including contraction, NMJ function, and differentiation.
Further, sodium and potassium channels contribute to
proper muscle and NMJ functioning by regulating
muscle contractions and mobilizing intracellular calcium
stores. The proper functioning of muscle fibers, along
with the ability of satellite cells to fuse into functional
muscle, requires the tight regulation of calcium influx,
efflux, and intracellular calcium mobilization [23, 24].
Further, NMJ, the critical neuromuscular link mediating
contraction, requires calcium for acetylcholine release
[18]. Adding complexity to this process is the interplay
between calcium and ion channels in which voltagegated Na+/K+ channels are essential to mediate signals
originating in the central nervous system to induce calcium release in muscle cells, thereby facilitating contraction. Our results show that CBA/SIV alters gene
regulatory networks that affect genes important for calcium and ion homeostasis, either through direct expression, post-transcriptional regulation by miRNA, or
altered methylation status. These results suggest that
CBA may reduce the ability of NMJ to transmit signals
to SKM fibers thereby affecting the mobilization of
intracellular calcium stores, which would decrease the
functionality of muscle contractions and the ability of
muscle satellite cells to successfully fuse to form new tissue in response to muscle injury.
Satellite cell growth and survival

Moderate everyday SKM use and injury trigger a cascade
of events important for muscle repair [19]. As part of
this response, the muscle stem cells (or myoblast satellite cells) proliferate, enter the myogenic program, and
fuse with existing muscle fibers. Once expanded, satellite

cells express and activate common myogenic factors, reorganize their cytoskeleton to mediate fusion, and interact with the ECM to not only repair the myofibers, but
also to restore the interaction between myofibers and
surrounding tissue environment. It was demonstrated
that in the absence of satellite cells, there is excessive accumulation of ECM and this adversely affects the increase in muscle mass in response to muscle overload
experiments [25]. Our results indicate that at end-stage
SIV infection, CBA negatively alters gene regulatory networks that affect genes important for cell growth and
survival, cytoskeleton reorganization or ECM involvement, and regulation of myogenesis. The expression of a
number of genes is affected, which when combined over
long periods of time, may significantly impact SKM regenerative capacity and contribute to SKM wasting.
The primary objective of the study was to identify a
global network of the transcriptomic and epigenomic

profiles from skeletal muscle derived from CBA/SIV
whole animal studies. We were able to confirm the differential expression of 3 selected upregulated miRNAs
and some of their target mRNAs by qPCR. ESR1, a target gene for 3 of the upregulated miRNAs (miR-34a,
miR-18 and miR-20), was downregulated in the gene
microarray, showed increased promoter methylation in
the methylation array, and decreased mRNA expression
as confirmed by qPCR in the SKM of CBA/SIV macaques. ESR1 is required for translocation of GLUT-4 receptors to the plasma membrane for glucose uptake. Its
role in development of insulin resistance has been demonstrated in ESR1 knockout mice. ESR1 is also required
for satellite cell proliferation [26–29]. Thus, decreased
ESR1 expression in the SKM of CBA/SIV macaques potentially contributes to impaired glucose homeostasis
and satellite cell growth. There was also a significant decrease in the expression of BCL-2, a target of miR-34a,

genes (521) in the SKM of CBA/SIV macaques (≥1.5-fold different) compared to SKM of SUC/SIV macaques) did not correlate with alterations in
miRNA or methylation. However, some of the differentially expressed genes were epigenetically regulated: changes in methylation status (24
genes), miRNA expression (1 gene), or both together (1 gene) were inversely proportional to the observed CBA-dependent changes in mRNA
gene expression. Further, there were CBA-dependent miRNA (163 target genes) and methylation (143 genes) alterations that were not found in
the mRNA data that potentially contribute to skeletal muscle wasting

normal muscle function and integrity. The orange octagons indicate the general biological functions required to maintain the function and/or

in the SKM of CBA/SIV macaques. BCL-2 promotes cellular survival [30] and may be implicated in satellite cell
growth and survival.
Taken together, our results allow us to propose a
model describing the CBA-dependent global alterations
in gene regulatory networks that contribute to muscle
wasting in end-stage SIV infection. In this model, normal muscle function requires functional contractile
muscle fibers, as well as the ability to activate fusion of
myoblast satellite cells to regenerate injured muscle tissue and the ability of pre-synaptic neurons to form functional neuromuscular junctions (Fig. 4). The occurrence
of each of these events depends on several subcategories
of biological functions. For example, the proper contractile functioning of muscle cells requires cell and tissue integrity, proper protein homeostasis, and the
presence of the mechanical components that drive contraction (Fig. 4, orange octagons). Each of these individual biological functions requires the finely balanced
expression of specific genes, a balance regulated through
transcriptional and epigenetic gene regulatory networks
(Fig. 4, yellow boxes). Adding to this finely balanced
regulatory network, many specific genes and miRNA
contribute to multiple biological functions, such as calcium and ion homeostasis, which work in a finely coordinated manner to facilitate muscle contraction; NMJ
function and myoblast satellite cell fusion; as well as
cytoskeletal integrity and ECM maintenance, which contribute to muscle regeneration and muscle tissue
integrity.
CBA administration promotes a persistent inflammatory SKM environment resulting from increased expression of a myriad of genes important for immunological
function, inflammatory responses, and ability to combat
oxidative stress (data not shown) [12, 13]. This persistent
inflammatory state promotes changes in transcriptional
and epigenetic regulation of hundreds of genes, either
through direct effects on the initiation of transcription
to alter the expression of genes and miRNA, the posttranscriptional miRNA regulation of mRNA stability and
translation, or the altered methylation status of gene
promoter regions (Fig. 3). These alterations produce
subtle and significant effects on the expression of genes,
which individually may not produce significant changes
but when combined as a whole, work to disrupt the
finely tuned balance required for normal muscle function and repair, thereby eliciting a gradual process of
muscle wasting.

Conclusion
Our results provide an integrated analysis of gene regulatory networks affecting SKM wasting in CBA/SIV macaques that extends our previous observations on ECM
[13] and protein homeostasis [20, 31]. Alterations in

Page 12 of 16

calcium and ion homeostasis, NMJ functions, deficiencies in growth, survival, and regenerative capability of
myoblasts, “universal” cellular functions, and gene regulatory networks expand the scope of CBA-mediated effects beyond those exclusive to maintaining protein
homeostasis. Together, these alterations create a global,
interconnected, and integrated network that leads to a
general loss of SKM mass due to the inability of muscles
to function, respond to, and repair damage and injury.

Methods
SKM used for these studies was obtained from animals
used in experiments approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at both Tulane National
Primate Research Center (TNPRC) in Covington, Louisiana and Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) in New Orleans, Louisiana, and adhered
to National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care
and use of experimental animals. The pathophysiological
course of SIV infection has been previously described in
published manuscripts [11–14]. A total of 28 4–6-yearold male macaques (Macaca mulatta) were studied in
three experimental groups: SUC/SIV group (n = 9),
CBA/SIV group (n = 11), and control group (n = 8). For
the control group, skeletal muscle samples were obtained at necropsy from a group of SIV-negative, healthy
control macaques and used as reference values for comparison of analyzed variables.
Experimental protocol

The gastric catheter placement for alcohol delivery, the
alcohol delivery protocol, and the route of SIV infection
have been described in detail elsewhere [11, 14, 32]. Animals were briefly exposed to daily intragastric administration of a mean of 2.5 g per kg body weight ethanol
(30 % w/v water), beginning 3 months prior to SIV infection and continuing throughout the duration of study.
This protocol of CBA administration provided an average of 15 % of the animals’ total daily caloric intake and
produced blood alcohol concentrations of 50–60 mM.
Control animals were infused with sucrose. Animals
were provided monkey chow (Lab Fiber Plus Primate
diet DT; PMI Nutrition International, St. Louis, MO) ad
libitum and supplemented with fruits, vitamins, and
Noyes treats (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ).
Three months after initiating CBA administration, animals were inoculated intravenously with 10,000 times
the 50 % infective dose (ID50) of SIVmac251. SIV disease
progression was monitored throughout the study period
through clinical, biochemical, and immunological parameters (CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratios) in addition to
plasma viral kinetics (SIV gag RNA levels) as described
elsewhere [12, 32]. SKM (gastrocnemius) samples were
obtained at necropsy when animals met any one of the

Simon et al. BMC Genomics (2015) 16:1097

criteria for euthanasia based on the following: (1) loss of
25 % of body weight from maximum body weight since
assignment to protocol, (2) major organ failure or medical conditions unresponsive to treatment, (3) surgical
complications unresponsive to immediate intervention,
or (4) complete anorexia for 4 days. SKM tissue samples
were dissected, snap frozen, and stored at −80 °C until
analyses. SKM samples from all animals in the three
treatment groups were used for the gene microarray,
microRNA microarray, methylation array and qPCR.
SKM samples used for the analysis in this study were
used in two previously published studies [13, 14].

mRNA Microarray analysis

To determine how CBA affects the expression of mRNA
at end-stage SIV infection, total RNA was isolated from
SKM at necropsy from a total of 28 animals (SUC/SIV
(n = 9), CBA/SIV (n = 11), and control (n = 8)) and
microarray analysis was performed as previously described on all samples [13]. Briefly, the microarray
hybridization was performed at the Stanley S. Scott Cancer Center’s Translational Genomics Core at LSUHSC in
New Orleans, Louisiana. Total RNA was extracted using
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was hybridized to Illumina HumanWG6_v3 chips (San Diego,
CA) following manufacturer’s instructions. For data analysis the samples were normalized using the cubic spline
algorithm, assuming that the distribution of transcripts
is similar [33]. Differential expression was determined by
comparing treatment and control groups using the Illumina Custom algorithm that assumes that target signal
intensity is normally distributed among replicates corresponding to some biological condition.
The fold change in gene expression of SUC/SIV and
CBA/SIV was obtained by dividing the expression level
of each gene by that of the control. The fold change of
CBA/SIV/SUC/SIV was obtained by dividing the expression level of each gene between CBA/SIV and SUC/SIV.
Comparisons between the gene expression levels of
CBA/SIV with SUC/SIV animals reflect the impact of
CBA on SIV-mediated changes in gene expression.
Genes whose expression was altered in an alcoholdependent manner by ≥1.5-fold were examined. The
GEO accession number is GSE59111.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was run on the
normalized, unfiltered microarray dataset as suggested
in the tools implementation (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) version 2.2.1) [34, 35] using the
c5.all.v5.symbols. (Gene ontology), running 1000 permutations and excluding gene sets with fewer than 5 genes
or more than 500. Using these parameters, 111 gene sets
were selected for the analysis. The GSEA statistics are

MicroRNA microarray analysis

To determine the impact of CBA on miRNA expression
at end-stage SIV infection, small RNA (<30 bp) were
purified. The microRNA microarray hybridization was
performed at the microarray core at LSUHSC. Briefly,
500 μg of total RNA was biotin-labeled using the FlashTag Biotin HSR kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples showed
expected labeling and the resulting targets were hybridized to miR 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) containing 15,644
microRNA probe sets from the miRBASE v15 (http://
microrna.sanger.ac.uk), which recognize microRNAs
from a number of organisms including human and rhesus macaques. The arrays were washed and processed
on a Fluidics Station 450 and scanned with a confocal
laser scanner (GeneChip Scanner 3000, Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data from
the microarrays were analyzed with Affymetrix microRNA QC Tool according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Differential miR expression was performed using
the One-Way ANOVA workflow with multiple test correction (FDR = 0.05) and selected from volcano plot
using p-value <0.05 and exhibiting a ≥ 1.5-fold change
cutoff.
All differentially regulated miRs were analyzed using
miRSystem (http://mirsystem.cgm.ntu.edu.tw/) [37].
miRSystem is a database which integrates seven miRNA
target gene prediction programs: DIANA, miRanda,
miRBridge, PicTar, PITA, rna22, and TargetScan. The
database also contains validated data from TarBase and
miRecords. To balance the reliability of the predictions,
three algorithm hits were used: 1) hypergeometric pvalue determination; 2) empirical p-value is determined
by ranking the enriched hypergeometric probability as
compared with null baseline probabilities. The null baseline probability was established by randomly selecting a
group of miRNAs, between 1 and 100, and using the default values in mirsystem to calculate the raw p-value for
each pathway [37]; and 3) a weighted pathway-ranking
method is also calculated from the expression ratios of the
differentially regulated miRNAs to rank the enriched pathways. For each functional category, the ranking score was
obtained by summation of the weight of its miRNA times
its enrichment -log (p-value) from the predicted target
n

genes Score ¼
AmiRNAwi½‐log10ðpiÞ . The target
genes, pathway ranking, and functional annotation summaries are included in the results. The parameters set for
analysis were: a) validated genes equal to or more than 3,
b) observed to expected ratio (O/E) greater or equal to 2
and c) total genes in the pathway ≥ 25 and ≤ 500.

Simon et al. BMC Genomics (2015) 16:1097

We also analyzed individual differentially expressed
miRNAs using miRTarBase and TargetScan. A search for
target genes using miRTarBase [38] determined that 4 of
the downregulated miRNA target 12 independent genes;
targeting is validated in the literature by at least two
independent experimental methods [38]. For the
remaining miRNAs that have no experimentally validated gene targets, we used the TargetScan database,
which identifies genes statistically predicted to be targets, using Homo sapiens as the reference. This search
identified 8 individual downregulated miRNAs predicted
to target 18 independent genes based on their predicted
efficacy of targeting (context score) [39, 40] or probability of conserved targeting (PCT) [41] [context score ≥
85 %; PCT ≥ 0.8] [42].

categorized by searching each individual gene in the
GeneCards® Human Genome Database (http://www.genecards.org). This is an integrative database that provides descriptions of gene functions as extracted from
multiple public databases, including Entrez Gene, UniProtKB, Tocris, Bioscience, and PharmGKB. Additional
information was derived from searching each individual
gene in the NCBI Gene Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/); the remaining genes with unclear biological function were analyzed using the DAVID
Bioinformatics Database (https://david.ncifcrf.gov). This
allowed for analysis of genes with specific functions relevant to skeletal muscle function. Those genes that did
not fall within any obvious biological function after these
analyses were classified as “Miscellaneous.” This analysis
is included as supplementary tables.

DNA methylation microarray analysis

To determine how CBA affects promoter methylation in
SIV-infection, the Infinium HumanMethylation27 array
was utilized. The Infinium HumanMethylation 27 examines more than 27,000 CpG islands in more than 14,000
genes’ promoters. SKM samples were bisulphiteconverted with Zymo EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo
Research, Irvine, CA, USA). GenomeStudio v2011.1
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with Methylation module 1.9.0 software was used in the methylation analysis.
The Infinium platform assays covers 96 % of CpG
islands with multiple sites in the island, the shores
(within 2 kb from CpG islands), and the shelves (>2 kb
from CpG islands). All the Illumina quality controls
were acceptable, including sample-independent and
dependent controls, staining controls, extension controls, target removal controls, hybridization controls,
bisulphite conversion I and II controls, specificity controls, non-polymorphic controls and negative controls.
Probes were considered to be differentially methylated if
the resulting adjusted p-value was <0.05. The BenjaminiHochberg method [43] was used to adjust the p-values
and ensure that the false discovery rate was <0.05. The
corresponding gene list was derived from the gene annotations associated with the probes. The GEO accession
number is GSE75729. Functional enrichment analyses of
genes with differential methylation of promoter regions
were performed using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources.
The gene ontology Biological Processes (BP_all) is represented for genes. The count: number of genes involved

The biological functions of individual differentially

q PCR (qPCR) for miR expression

To validate the deep sequencing data, the relative expression of 3 differentially expressed miRs (miR-34a,
miR-10b, miR-20) was further determined by individual
Taqman miR assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Approximately 200–250 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed
using the stem loop primers provided in the predesigned
kit and ~1.3 μl of cDNA was subjected to 40 cycles of
PCR on the CFX96 Bio-Rad PCR cycler (Bio-Rad) using
the following thermal cycling conditions: 50 °C for
2 min, 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 repetitive cycles
of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. As a normalization
control for RNA loading, SNOU6 were amplified in duplicate wells on the same multi-well plate.
qPCR for target genes of differentially regulated miRNAs

Total RNA isolated for miR sequencing studies was used
for gene expression analysis as well. cDNA was synthesized from 1000 ng of the resulting total RNA using the
Quantitect Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Qiagen), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers
were designed to span exon-exon junctions (IDT, Coralville, IA) and used at a concentration of 500 nmol. The
final reactions were made to a total volume of 20 μl with
Quantitect SyBr Green PCR kit (Qiagen). All reactions
were carried out in duplicate on a CFX96 system (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) for qPCR detection.
qPCR data were analyzed using the comparative Ct
(delta-delta-Ct, ΔΔCT) method. Target genes were compared with the endogenous control (ribosomal protein
S13 (RPS13)) and CBA/SIV and SUC/SIV values were
normalized to controls.
