Abstract
Aims/hypothesis: Obesity increases the risk of developing major diseases such as diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue, particularly adipocytes, may play a major role in the
development of obesity and its comorbidities. The aim of this study was to characterise, in adipocytes
from obese people, the most differentially expressed genes that might be relevant to the development
of obesity. Methods: We carried out microarray gene profiling of isolated abdominal subcutaneous
adipocytes from 20 non-obese (BMI 25±3 kg/m2) and 19 obese (BMI 55± 8 kg/m2) non-diabetic
Pima Indians using Affymetrix HG-U95 GeneChip arrays. After data analyses, we measured the
transcript levels of selected genes based on their biological functions and chromosomal positions
using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: The most differentially expressed genes in adipocytes of
obese individuals consisted of 433 upregulated and 244 downregulated genes. Of these, 410 genes

could be classified into 20 functional Gene Ontology categories. The analyses indicated that the
inflammation/immune response category was over-represented, and that most inflammation-related
genes were upregulated in adipocytes of obese subjects. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the
transcriptional upregulation of representative inflammation-related genes (CCL2 and CCL3)
encoding the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory
protein 1α. The differential expression levels of eight positional candidate genes, including
inflammation-related THY1 and C1QTNF5, were also confirmed. These genes are located on
chromosome 11q22-q24, a region with linkage to obesity in the Pima Indians. Conclusions/
interpretation: This study provides evidence supporting the active role of mature adipocytes in
obesity-related inflammation. It also provides potential candidate genes for susceptibility to obesity.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Obesity is characterised by increased adipose tissue mass resulting from a chronic energy
imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure [1]. It is widely accepted that both
genetic and environmental factors (such as diet) can predispose individuals to the development
of obesity [2]. In the United States, more than 30% of the adult population are categorised as
obese, defined as having a BMI of over 30 kg/m2 [3]. The increasing prevalence of obesity in
recent decades as a public health problem in both developed and developing countries is of
concern given the comorbidities of this condition. Obesity is recognised as a risk factor for
insulin resistance, which can lead to major diseases, such as type 2 diabetes [4] and
cardiovascular disease [5].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A higher risk of obesity-associated metabolic diseases is associated with increased adipose
tissue mass in the abdominal region [6]. The role of adipose tissue in the aetiology of obesity
[7], as well as its pathophysiological consequences [8], is increasingly being recognised. A
few studies in rodents and humans have used microarray gene expression profiling of whole
adipose tissue to investigate its role in obesity [9,10]. Unfortunately, the heterogeneous cell
composition of adipose tissue does not provide information on the potentially diverse functions
of the specific cell types of the tissue. Adipose tissue contains a mixture of mature, lipid-filled
adipocytes and stromal vascular cells, including adipocyte precursor cells (preadipocytes),
macrophages, fibroblasts, mast cells and vascular cells [11]. The degree of macrophage
infiltration of adipose tissue has been shown to be associated with obesity [12,13], and
macrophage infiltration may play a role in adipose tissue inflammation [14]. Higher expression
levels and/or concentrations of inflammatory factors in adipose tissue are associated with
increased systemic inflammation in obesity, which may explain, at least in part, the increased
risk of obesity-related comorbidities [14].
The function of mature adipocytes as a major cell type in adipose tissue extends beyond lipid
storage. These cells actively participate in energy metabolism by secreting bioactive molecules
called adipokines, which can act in an autocrine, paracrine, intracrine and/or endocrine fashion
[15]. Leptin, a well-known adipokine, can cause obesity by its absence in the ob/ob mouse
[16]; this has also been reported in humans [17]. Circulating levels of adiponectin, another
well-studied adipokine, are positively correlated with the expression of mRNA encoding
adiponectin in adipose tissue, and negatively correlated with obesity-associated insulin
resistance [18]. Inflammatory adipokines, such as TNF-α, may contribute to adipose tissue
inflammation [14]. Adipocytes may express other genes that contribute to the aetiology or
pathophysiology of obesity.

The aim of this study was to investigate the gene expression profiles of isolated adipocytes
from abdominal subcutaneous adipose depots in obese and non-obese non-diabetic Pima
Indians, a population with one of the highest prevalence rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes
[19]. This study was carried out to characterise the most differentially expressed genes in
adipocytes from the two subject groups. As a complementary approach to our ongoing
positional cloning effort, this study may also help to identify candidate susceptibility genes for
obesity on chromosome 11q22-q24, the peak of linkage to obesity in this population [20].

Subjects and methods
Subjects
All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation. This study was approved
by the Tribal Council of the Gila River Indian Community and by the Institutional Review
Board of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The
anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of the subjects are described in Table 1. All
subjects were in good health, as determined by medical history, physical examination and
routine blood and urine tests, and none were taking medication at the time of the study.
Metabolic measurements

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Volunteers were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit, NIDDK, Phoenix, AZ, USA, where
they consumed a weight-maintaining diet (containing 50% of calories as carbohydrates, 30%
as fat and 20% as protein) for 2-3 days prior to clinical testing. BMI was calculated as weight
(in kg) divided by the square of height (in m2). Body composition was measured by dual energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using a total body scanner (DPX-L; Lunar Radiation, Madison,
WI, USA), as described previously [21]. A 3-h 75-g OGTT was performed after a 12-h
overnight fast. Diabetes was defined according to the criteria of the World Health Organization.
Fat biopsy and extraction of total RNA from isolated adipocytes and adipose tissue

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsies were obtained from 58 non-diabetic Pima Indians.
Samples from 39 subjects were used for microarray hybridisation, and those from 19
individuals for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) of specific inflammation-related genes. After an
overnight fast, subjects underwent subcutaneous abdominal fat needle biopsies under local
anaesthesia with 1% lidocaine. Collagenase digestion of the adipose tissue biopsy was carried
out as described previously [22], and the floating adipocyte fraction was collected. Total RNA
was extracted from adipose tissue and isolated mature adipocytes using an RNeasy Lipid Mini
Kit and an RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA), respectively. During the
extraction, RNA was treated with DNase using the RNase-free DNAse Set (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Microarray
Target preparation, array hybridisation and scanning Double-stranded cDNA for each subject
was synthesised using the Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A 10μg aliquot of adipocyte total RNA from each subject was first used to synthesise single-stranded
cDNA and then biotin-labelled cRNA, as recommended by the manufacturer of the microarray
(Affymetrix; Santa Clara, CA, USA). Labelled cRNA from each sample was individually
hybridised to the five microarray chips included in the Affymetrix Human Genome U95 (HGU95A, B, C, D, and E) Set, which contains a total of approximately 60,000 probe sets.
Following hybridisation, the washing and staining procedure was performed in the Affymetrix
GeneChip Fluidics Station. To enhance the signals, an antibody amplification step was added
using normal goat IgG and biotinylated goat anti-streptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA). The arrays were scanned twice using a Hewlett Packard GeneArray

scanner (Palo Alto, CA, USA). Raw data were analysed using Microarray Suite, Version 5.0
software (Affymetrix). To allow comparison of microarray data across different arrays and
individual samples, we normalised the data by global scaling to an arbitrary target intensity
value of 2,500 using Microarray Suite 5.0 software. The data for absolute analysis have been
deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; available at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, last accessed in June 2005) and may be accessed through GEO
Series accession number GSE2508.
Quantitative RT-PCR We used quantitative RT-PCR to verify the differential expression levels
of several genes based on either their biological functions or chromosomal locations. Genes in
the biological function category were verified using the cDNA samples from adipocytes
isolated from nine non-obese and ten obese Pima Indians who were different from those who
provided the microarray data (Table 1). Confirmation of the biologically relevant genes in this
separate group of subjects should help control for stochastic biological sampling error
exacerbated by multiple testing.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As a preliminary step in our effort to complement the ongoing positional cloning of obesity
susceptibility genes in Pima Indians, we also verified the differential expression of 12 positional
candidate genes. These genes are located on chromosome 11q22-q24, which encompasses the
linkage peak to BMI in Pima Indians [20]. Quantitative RT-PCR of these genes was carried
out using cDNA samples from the subjects used to obtain the microarray data, as differential
expression of these genes might be associated with genetic variations of the subjects.
Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out as previously described [22], using TaqMan Assays-onDemand Gene Expression Products (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to measure
the level of transcription of all tested genes except for two positional candidate genes. The two
genes, THY1 and SNF1LK2 (formerly known as SIK2 or KIAA0781), were analysed using
Assays-by-Design products (Applied Biosystems). The mRNA expression of each gene was
normalised to that of the gene encoding human TATA-box binding protein (TBP) (Applied
Biosystems), a normalising gene that was invariable in isolated human adipocyte samples, as
assessed by both microarray and quantitative RT-PCR methods (data not shown).
Data analyses

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The raw microarray data obtained from Microarray Suite, Version 5.0 software were analysed
using the Mann-Whitney U-test, as well as the two-sided t-test corrected for unequal variances
(Welch test) to compare the mean expression level for each gene between the non-obese and
obese individuals. The Bayesian posterior probability of being a false discovery (expressed as
false discovery rate [FDR]) was estimated for each probe set individually, based on the Welch
p values, using a mixture model described elsewhere [23,24]. We focused on the genes among
those most differentially expressed that had corresponding probe sets with a less than 0.1%
FDR, i.e. with a posterior probability of being differentially expressed of 99.9%. These genes
were annotated with their chromosomal locations, UniGene number, LocusLink ID and Gene
Ontology (GO) information (according to biological process, cellular component and
molecular function) using NetAffx resources [25]. Genes that could not be annotated using
NetAffx were classified using the Human Proteome Survey Database [26]. We used OntoExpress (available at http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu:8080/index.jsp, last accessed in June 2005)
[27] to calculate whether any of the GO terms were significantly over-represented among the
most differentially expressed genes, as determined by hypergeometric p values. A two-sided
binomial test was used to calculate whether there was a significant difference between the
numbers of upregulated and downregulated genes within each GO class. The p value
calculation is only valid if the expression levels of the genes are independent; thus, the p values
reported for these analyses should only be considered as heuristic ranking statistics.

The quantitative RT-PCR data on those genes that were differentially expressed between the
obese and the non-obese groups were analysed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test, with a p
value of less than 0.05 considered significant.

Results
The most differentially expressed genes The distribution of p values for all probe sets hybridised
with adipocyte samples from non-obese and obese subjects showed that there were more than
3.5 times as many genes with significant differential expression (i.e. a p value of between 0
and 0.05) than would be expected at random. The plot of p values for all (approximately 60,000)
probe sets can be seen in Fig. 1 of the Electronic supplementary material (ESM).
A subset of 703 probe sets with a less than 0.1% FDR (an arbitrary cut-off level that indicated
the highest probability of being truly differentially expressed between the two groups) was
selected for further analysis. These probe sets had p values less than 0.00002 by the Welch test
and less than 0.0001 according to the Mann-Whitney U-test. At these p values, practically none
of the genes identified as being significantly different between the obese and non-obese
subjects would be false positives, whereas approximately 75% of the genes called nonsignificant would truly not be different between the two groups (data not shown).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because some of the transcripts were represented on multiple probe sets, the selected 703 probe
sets corresponded to 677 unique transcripts. Of these 677 transcripts, 433 were upregulated
and 244 were downregulated in mature adipocytes of obese individuals. The 651 genes
corresponding to the 677 transcripts were localised to specific chromosomal regions, and 410
genes were classified into 20 GO Biological Process categories (Table 2). The identification
of each gene, its gene symbol, chromosomal location, representative probe set and the relative
expression of the gene in adipocytes of obese subjects (upregulated or downregulated compared
with non-obese control subjects) are presented in Table 1 of the ESM. These 410 most
differentially expressed genes will be the focus of the remainder of this manuscript, unless
otherwise noted.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Over-represented GO Biological Process categories The GO Biological Process category with
the highest number of differentially expressed genes was inflammation/immune responses (54
genes). Furthermore, there were significantly more genes in this category (52 out of 54)
showing increased expression in adipocytes of obese subjects. The upregulated inflammationrelated genes included those encoding chemotactic factors for monocytes/macrophages
(chemokines) and those encoding members of the complement system, immunoglobulin
superfamily and interferon pathway (ESM Table 1). The chemokine genes consisted of those
encoding monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; gene symbol CCL2), macrophage
inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α; CCL3), MIP-1β (CCL4), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand
1 (CXCL1), macrophage inflammatory protein 2α (MIP-2α; CXCL2), MIP-2β (CXCL3),
stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1; CXCL12), and interleukin-8 (IL8, formerly known as
CXCL8). Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a lymphokine that regulates
macrophage function in inflammation, and chemokine-like factor super family 3 (CKLFSF3),
a potential chemokine, were also upregulated in adipocytes of obese subjects. The increased
expression of representative inflammatory genes (CCL2 and CCL3) in a separate group of nine
non-obese subjects, as compared with ten obese subjects, was confirmed by quantitative RTPCR (Fig. 1).
To assess whether the inflammation/immune response genes in the adipocytes of obese subjects
were actually genes expressed by potentially contaminating adipose tissue macrophages, we
examined the expression of several macrophage genes (ADAM8, CD163, CD68, EMR1,
FCGR1A, ITGAM, MARCO). All probe sets, apart from one coding for CD163, were assigned
an absent call for all subjects, as determined by the Microarray Suite software, and none were

differentially expressed between the non-obese and obese subjects. The expression levels of
CD68 and EMR1 were further determined using quantitative RT-PCR. The lack of differential
CD68 expression between the two groups was confirmed, despite the presence of CD68 mRNA
transcripts in adipocyte samples from all subjects (data not shown). The expression of EMR1
in adipocytes was not detectable by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown).
The other two over-represented GO Biological Process categories were cellular signalling and
transcription regulation. The former category included the genes adrenomedullin;
phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 1; regulator of G-protein signalling 2;
adrenergic, beta, receptor kinase 2; phosphodiesterase 3B, cGMP-inhibited; protein
phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 1B; and protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit
B (B56), alpha isoform. The transcription regulation category included the genes nuclear
receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 (glucocorticoid receptor); forkhead box C1; E2F
transcription factor 4, p107/p130-binding; and Sp1 transcription factor. In contrast to the
category of inflammation/immune response, described above, the numbers of upregulated and
downregulated genes within these two broad categories were not significantly different.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The remaining categories were not significantly over-represented, but a few categories had a
significantly greater number of upregulated genes (cell cycle control/cell proliferation, cell
adhesion, structural protein/cytoskeleton organisation, apoptosis, proteolysis/peptidolysis, cell
growth and maintenance, blood coagulation), and one category had a significantly greater
number of downregulated genes (energy pathway/electron transport).
Quantitative RT-PCR confirmation of the differential expression of positional candidate genes
for obesity There were 12 differentially expressed genes that mapped to chromosome 11q22q24, the region with linkage to BMI in the Pima Indians [20]. Six of these positional candidate
genes were upregulated in adipocytes of obese subjects (C1q and tumor necrosis factor related
protein 5 [C1QTNF5]; Thy-1 cell surface antigen [THY1]; fasciculation and elongation protein
zeta 1 [FEZ1]; nicotinamide N-methyltransferase [NNMT]; hypoxia up-regulated 1
[HYOU1]; and transgelin [TAGLN]), and six were downregulated (immunoglobulin
superfamily, member 4 [IGSF4]; vacuolar protein sorting 11 [VPS11]; acetyl-Coenzyme A
acetyltransferase 1 [ACAT1]; SNF1-like kinase 2 [SNF1LK2]; sterol-C5-desaturase-like
protein [SC5DL]; and round-about axon guidance receptor, homolog 3 [ROBO3]). Notably,
C1QTNF5 and THY1 are classed as inflammation/immune response genes (ESM Table 1).
The quantitative RT-PCR results for the 12 positional candidate genes confirmed the
differential expression of all six upregulated genes and two of the six downregulated genes
(Table 3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Discussion
The results of this study indicate that the genes in isolated abdominal subcutaneous adipocytes
that are most differentially expressed between non-diabetic obese subjects and non-diabetic
non-obese subjects are those classified as involving inflammation/immune response. The fact
that a larger proportion of inflammation-related genes were upregulated (rather than
downregulated) in adipocytes of the obese individuals further implies an active role for these
cells in adipose tissue inflammation. Increased levels of transcripts for these inflammationrelated genes will presumably result in increased secretion of these factors from adipocytes.
Some of these inflammation-related genes encode chemokines, such as MCP-1 and MIP-1α,
that can attract monocytes/macrophages to infiltrate adipose tissue. Other upregulated genes
encode adhesion molecules, such as fibronectin and integrin, that may help retain any
infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in the tissue. These data are in line with recent studies
indicating that the percentage of adipose tissue macrophages is positively correlated with
obesity [12,13]. The resident macrophages may be an important source of inflammation in the

tissue [12,13]. Further investigation of the contribution of augmented adipose tissue
inflammation to the pathophysiology of obesity is warranted.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The increased expression of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules in adipocytes of obese
individuals might have been induced, at least in part, by proinflammatory factors derived from
the adipocytes themselves, such as TNF-α [28]. Consistent with previous studies (for review
see [29]), adipocyte TNF-α expression was upregulated in obese subjects, as assessed by
microarray and quantitative RT-PCR (p=0.05 and p=0.01, respectively; data not shown);
however, TNF-α was excluded from our list of the most differentially expressed genes because
the FDR of the gene was higher than the arbitrary cut-off value of 0.1%.
We investigated whether the observed upregulation of inflammation-related genes in
adipocytes of obese subjects was due to contamination of the adipocyte preparation by
macrophages. The lack of differential expression of macrophage markers between obese and
non-obese subjects indicates that the increased levels of expression of chemokines in
adipocytes of obese subjects were not directly derived from the potentially higher number of
macrophages that might have contaminated the adipocyte fraction during isolation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The expression of other inflammation-related genes, such as those induced by interferon, were
also increased in the adipocytes of obese subjects. The elevated levels of these interferonresponsive genes might constitute a reaction to interferon secreted by lymphocytes, thus
implicating the potential role of lymphocytes in adipose tissue inflammation in obese subjects.
This possibility warrants further investigation, since the presence of lymphocytes in adipose
tissue remains a controversial topic.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The standard adipocyte isolation procedure using collagenase digestion has been reported to
induce the expression of many inflammation-related genes [30]. Nevertheless, the differential
expression of inflammation-related genes in this study was unlikely to be caused by the
isolation procedure, since all samples were subject to similar isolation procedures. A similar
upregulation of inflammation-related genes was observed in preadipocytes/stromal vascular
cells of adipose tissue from obese Pima Indians that had been cultured for a couple of weeks
[31]. The cultured cells had presumably recovered from acute inflammatory responses induced
by collagenase digestion, similar to unpublished observations that the expression of proinflammatory genes, including TNF and IL1B, by stromal vascular cells is reduced to levels
comparable to those measured prior to collagenase digestion (X. Xu and A. Ferrante, Naomi
Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, NY, USA). Furthermore, a recent study by
Clement et al. [32] reported that the expression of inflammation-related genes in adipose tissue
of obese subjects decreased following weight loss. Taken together, the results imply that the
upregulation of inflammation-related genes in the adipocytes of obese subjects in our study
was not simply due to the adipocyte isolation procedure itself. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude
the possibility that compared with adipose tissue samples from non-obese people, those from
obese individuals are predisposed to increased expression of inflammatory-related genes when
subjected to the adipocyte isolation procedure.
With respect to the most differentially expressed genes, the other over-represented GO
Biological Process categories were cellular signalling and transcription regulation. The
numbers of upregulated vs downregulated genes in these categories were not different between
non-obese and obese subjects; furthermore, the genes did not indicate any specific molecular
pathways.
The general upregulation of genes in the categories of cell cycle control/cell proliferation,
structural protein/cytoskeleton organisation, and cell growth and maintenance might reflect
the ability of adipocytes from obese subjects to accommodate increased cell size. On the other
hand, the adipocytes of obese subjects had decreased expression of genes encoding energy

pathway/electron transport. The overall gene expression profile of these isolated human
adipocytes is similar to that of the adipose tissue of diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice [14]
and that of genetically obese (ob/ob) mice with a mutation in the gene encoding leptin on
different strain backgrounds [9,12,13]. Further studies are required to investigate the relative
contributions of genetic background and dietary intake to the differential adipocyte gene
expression in obese people.

As a complementary approach to linkage analysis in identifying candidate susceptibility genes
for obesity in this population, we used quantitative RT-PCR to confirm the differential
expression levels of genes on chromosome 11q22-q24. This chromosome region encompasses
the linkage peak to BMI in Pima Indians [20]. The region contains two inflammation-related
genes, THY1 and C1QTNF5, together with a further ten of the most differentially expressed
genes. THY1 is a major cell surface glycoprotein; its expression in activated endothelial cells
facilitates the adhesion and transendothelial migration of monocytes [33]. C1QTNF5 is a
member of the C1q tumor necrosis factor superfamily, which is likely to be involved in
inflammation [34]. The upregulated expression of THY-1 and C1QTNF5 in adipocytes from
obese subjects was confirmed, as well as four other upregulated genes (HYOU1, NNMT,
TAGLN, FEZ1), and two other downregulated genes (IGSF4 and SC5DL). The differential
expression of these genes in adipocytes may contribute to, or result from, obesity. Notably,
HYOU1 was identified as the gene encoding oxygen regulated protein (150 kDa), a member
of heat shock protein 70 family, which may play a role in protein folding and secretion in the
endoplasmic reticulum [35]. This gene is also upregulated in skeletal muscle of obese insulinresistant Pima Indians, as compared with equally obese but insulin-sensitive control subjects,
and polymorphisms in this gene are associated with insulin resistance, but not with BMI [36].
The other genes with confirmed differential expression, including THY1 and C1QTNF5, serve
as good positional candidate genes for obesity that are transcriptionally dysregulated in
adipocytes. Further screening of genetic polymorphisms that may be associated with obesity
in/surrounding these genes in Pima Indians is underway.
In terms of candidate genes for obesity in other populations, it is interesting to note that one
such candidate gene—NR3C1 on chromosome 5q31, which encodes glucocorticoid receptor
—was downregulated in adipocytes of obese subjects in this study. The expression of this gene
was also reduced in cultured preadipocytes/stromal vascular fraction of obese Pima Indians
[22]. NR3C1 belongs to the category of transcription regulation, and a single nucleotide
polymorphism in exon 2 of the gene (N363S) has been shown to be associated with obesity in
two different study populations [37,38].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In summary, the expression of genes involving inflammation/immune response was increased
in isolated abdominal subcutaneous adipocytes from obese people, indicating the active role
of mature adipocytes in obesity-related inflammation. Two inflammation-related genes were
localised to chromosome 11q22-q24 where there is a linkage to BMI in Pima Indians; together
with six other genes in this region with confirmed differential expression, these genes serve as
good candidate genes for obesity.

Confirmation of the increased mRNA expression levels of CCL2 (MCP-1) and CCL3
(MIP-1α) in adipocyte samples from obese subjects by quantitative RT-PCR. Adipocyte
samples were isolated from abdominal subcutaneous biopsies from a group of nine non-obese
(white bars) and ten obese (black bars) Pima Indians who were separate from those who
provided the microarray data. The expression of CCL2 (MCP-1) (a) and CCL3 (MIP-1α) (b)
was normalised to that of TBP. The data are presented as means±SEM. *p=0.02 vs lean
subjects; **p=0.04 vs lean subjects
